Entrance to a Cave~
This cave entrance is very damp and cold and you can see your breath as you
enter. The cave continues to the north where it gets quite dark. It would be a
good idea to bring a light to see as you explore.

You are standing in a large, damp cave.  There are several stalagmites hanging
here with sharp points and some glowing fungus on the north wall.  There also
seems to be a small campsite here, as if someone may be living in this cave.

Hidden Cave~
You are in a small cave that branches off from the main cavern.  A pile of
rubble hides the exit here, but is easily passable.  It seems there was once a
cave-in here, blocking any further progress.  Some large mushrooms grow here
that are emitting a bad aroma.
