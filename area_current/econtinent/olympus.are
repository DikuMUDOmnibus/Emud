This is the haven of the great Greek gods and Godesses. There are many
mysterious and magical wonders here. Beware of the gods of war though,
because they may be tougher than you think.

Zeus~
Zeus sits here on a throne.~
You see before you the greatest of the Olympians.  It seems as if he could
destroy you with a thought.  Every glance penetrates deep into your soul.
You now know what true fear is. Maybe instead of fighting him you should
seek the aid of the gods.
