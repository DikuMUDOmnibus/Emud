{138}                               Mushroom Forest
{308}
In the far reaches of the eastern continent lies the mushroom forest.
The mushroom people are a generally happy people, but rumors have been
going around that not all is as blissful as it seems.  Sounds of war
below the forest grounds can be heard even in the highest tree tops.
The mushroom people are ruled by the Toadstool clan.  Long ago in the
mushroom wars, the Toadstool clan defeated the evil Fungus clan and 
vowed to protect the fair people who live in the mushroom forest.
It is feared the fungus clan may be trying to rebuild its empire and
overthrow the surface dwellers of mushroom forest.

A trail in the hills~
High rolling hills swarm about you like bees.  The small narrow paths are
lined with moss.  Tall grass sways to and fro in the wind, making an almost
eerie sound whisper in the hills.  The ground is moist and slightly muddy.
  The path leads north into the hills and south back to the valley.
  A lone mushroom grows on the ground here.

The war planning room~
Huge maps of the forest are attached to the walls in this room.  A large
stone table sits in the middle of the room with miniature figures marking
places upon it.  Guards march about the table rubbing their foreheads
totally oblivous to your presense.

The powder room~
Carefully stepping through this room shows a large number of stone wooden
barrels with large skulls painted on the sides.  More than likely they are
loaded with sulfer, sea-gull droppings, charcoal, and other ingredients.
There are no torches in this room for most obvious reasons.  The dark room
north of here probably was loaded with similar barrels at one time.

The sacrificial pit~
This place has the horrid stench of rotted mushrooms everywhere.  In the
middle of this dark dank chamber is a huge pit, possibly thirty feet wide.
Try not to slip and fall, it could hurt really really bad.  You were warned.
This must be how the Fungus clan deals with traitors and deserters.

This room is, obviously enough, where people wait to have an exclusive

The scent of incense fills this hut.  Mists swirl about in a very
magical way.  The room appears almost tropical with all of the very
magestic mushrooms growing everywhere.  Never before have you gazed

fills you with a sense of wisdom and power.
