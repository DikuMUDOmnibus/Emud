{300}
The University was founded many centuries ago as a method of teaching
young men and women the arts of battle as well as other arts.  The
students of today however seem to see it as a way of life rather than
a temporary place of learning on the long journey.  All are welcome to
apply at the Secretary for graduation.

teaching the class wonders what you are doing, intruding on her lesson.
