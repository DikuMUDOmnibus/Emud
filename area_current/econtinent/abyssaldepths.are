{300}
Little is known about the Abyss, and I have been unable to obtain much
information about the ancient machinery which pulses underneath the domed
city of Atlantis, as the citizens there are protective of their life
breathing treasures.  It is rumoured that much of the water on the Eastern
Continent is under the direct control of the Atlantis water works, but such
rumours are largely unsubstantiated.  Explore at your own risk.

of garbage which completely fills the bottom of the shear-walled steel
shaft.  In fact, you are immersed in the pile of rotting, half-decayed
garbage, and your nose is quickly overpowered and ceases to function.
As you slowly sink into the pile, you glimpse a hallway leading away

Under the Mammoth Pump.~
It's a wonder you've managed to squeeze under the pump as you have.
Now that you're here, your ears are making you wish you weren't.  You
have to admire the craftsmanship of whoever built these pumps in any
case.  The pumps were probably pumping water long before the elves
built their miraculous cities in the great eastern deserts.

The Tunnel Dock~
The catwalk comes to an abrupt end in front of what looks to be the
entrance to a long tunnel.  There is some sort of membrane preventing
entry into the tunnel to the north.  You hear the endless drone of

are some large scrolls on the tables which are seemingly organized but
not in any manner you recognize.  The air is humid because of a large
uncovered tank filled with briny water at the north end of the room.

Viewing Deck~
You are overcome as you climb up onto the viewing deck.  The room is more
of a pod than a room, a bubble with a wraparound view of the ocean outside.
Laterally, you can make out the dome stretching out as far as you can see,
flashing and pulsating with strange lights and colors.  Out in the murky
sea above, you catch an occasional glimpse ofa florescent fish or squid,
but beyond that lies only darkness.  The deck glows with the dark blue of
the ocean about, the ocean lit only by light from the domed city of Atlantis.

All that is left of this once idyllic pond is a thick grey mud which
sucks at your legs.  A small pipe protrudes from the mud at one end
of the pond, capped with a small grate.  A few copper and silver coins
sparkle in the sunlight, but not enough to make a full-scale
reclamation very profitable.  A leech attaches itself to your foot.

This room used to have a greater purpose, but now it serves as the home of a
curmudgeonly man with hair to his feet and a beard to match.  Bits of plants
and the bones from a dozen small rodents litter the floor.  The air is musty

stands open to the south.  Air pressure in the room must balance the
pressure of the water below, because your ears feel like they're about to

suddenly quite cold.

The Docking Bay~
You find yourself standing at the end of a filthy platform.  Clouds of
black ash partially blot out the ochre light which is escaping a small
dirty lightbulb in the ceiling.  An ash-caked hallway leads off to the
north, and a thin membrane prevents passage to the west.
