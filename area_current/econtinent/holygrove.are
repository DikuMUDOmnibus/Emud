thanks for bountiful harvests in the fall, and where lovers stroll in
the summer.

leaving You calm and invigorated, ready for the world. Paths lead into the

Dragons, a rather fearsome picture of Norse Chaos incarnate, a grainy black-

Dalvenjah the Mindijaran and Allan the man become dragon. There are three
empty frames labeled 'The Chimerical', 'The Mythical' and 'The Hypothetical',
A panoramic picture of Strabo flying between the worlds dominate one wall,
while a dragons-eye view of Pern (with dragons in the foreground, of course)
fills another. There even are a few rare medieval renditions of the great
beast of the Revelation. Over the head of the table hangs a rather modest
