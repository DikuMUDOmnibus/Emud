{138}                                Manitou Marsh{300}

Manitou Marsh is a fetid swamp situated on the eastern continent of the realms.
It is reputed to be the home of a terrible undead creature known as the Manitou,
however those who have ventured there report no sign of the beast. Legends say
that the Manitou was an evil chieftan of a tribe living in the marshes who was
responsible for the drowning of his entire tribe in order to further his own
lifespan. The evil chieftan might have wreaked further havoc but a mighty
warlock confronted him and in retribution imprisoned him inside the corpse of
his very first victim.

There are two little quests in this area, one has no fighting at all and rewards
you with a nice low level pair of gloves, the other involves discovering and
slaying a monster - could it be the Manitou? :) - for a couple of pieces of nice
armor.

This area is designed to be a fun little area for new players of Storms of Time.
There is lots of equipment to improve fighting skills, but be warned you will
not find it all in one trip to the area. If you spend some time leveling in the
area you should find almost everything.

A wild-eyed hermit is standing here.~
This wiry little man has a wild mane of dirty brown hair and is wearing a simple
cotton smock. The smock was once white but is now a dull grey with brown and
green stains everywhere. The man's eyes roam about wildly as he watches you with
suspiscion.

A lost adventurer slogs through the marsh here.~
This young man looks weary as he slogs through the marshes. His hair is dank
with sweat and he grimaces with each step through the stinking water. From his
mismatched equipment you suspect he is quite new at adventuring and has been
lured to this marsh by tales of easy treasure.

A muddy cave~
This muddy cave is small enough that only a dwarf or gnome would feel
comfortable in it. Droplets of dingy water drip from the ceiling, and the mud
squelches underfoot.

The muddy ruins of a stone room~
The muddy cave has opened out into what is apparently the ruins of a cellar or
basement or something similar. You can make out ancient blocks of stone showing
through the mud covering one wall. This room appears to have been buried in a
mudslide years ago. You feel a sense of forboding in this place.

A treehouse~
This wooden platform has a little wooden hut built atop it. Considering the
desolate location the construction is surprisingly well-thought out. Little
signs of habitation are dotted around the platform, including hooks for hanging
clothing and cooking utensils, and a fireplace made of river rocks. A rope
ladder hangs off the side of the platform.
