{128}                                  Atlantis
{308}
The story of Atlantis is a sketchy one.  The historians of the mushroom
village honor the Lord of Water who rules the seas and holds the lives of
those that take their existance from the water depths in the palm of His
mighty hand.  It is said that to the north of the mushroom forest once lived
an advanced race of clever people.  Their technology led them to great
achievement, so great that they managed to offend their god along the way,
and were duly punished.  This is where the stories fragment into embellishment, but if you spend time on the eastern continent,
you may indeed hear tales of intrepid explorers who have stumbled their way
into a city of bright turquoise, full of wonder and religious severity, and
never returned...

You have entered a large cavern carved by the ravages of a swiftly-flowing
underground river.  The water is black and deep, it's current making it
impossible to swim across.  You see a glint of something curious on the
wall on the opposite bank of the river.  The river flows out of a crack
in the wall to the west and follows the cavern to the east.

Before a Large Green Hedge.~
You have emerged into bright sunlight, or at least it appears to be
sunlight.  You can't quite make out the sun, and the sky is a bit too
blue.  You blink your eyes and notice that you've run aground amidst
tall grasses and amber waves of grain.  The river that carried you
here now plummets under ground once again, into a hole far too small
to accomodate you.  There is a large hedge to the north, which appears
to have been burrowed through.  Endless fields surround you on all
sides.  There is enough food here to feed a large city.

Before the Prince's Podium~
You stand before the steps up to a huge ornate podium, from whence the
proceedings of the city are administered in an authoritative fashion.
While the city prides itself in its belief in due process and the
democratic ideal, it is the prince who has the ultimate say in affairs
of the state.  The stairs are ornate but well-used, while the podium
reflects the communal and universal worship of the sea which has its
grip on this city.  There are two alcoves, one to your left and one to
the right.

This room used to have a greater purpose, but now it serves as the

puckers at you through the clear spot.  The entire city must be lit
from one light source which reflects evenly off the entire inner

Somehow, a dwarf has made a home in this desolate city sector.  Among

Before a Large Green Hedge.~
You have emerged into bright sunlight, or at least it appears to be
sunlight.  You can't quite make out the sun, and the sky is a bit too
blue.  You blink your eyes and notice that you've run aground amidst
tall grasses and amber waves of grain.  The river that carried you
here now plummets under ground once again, into a hole far too small
to accomodate you.  There is a large hedge to the north, which appears
to have been burrowed through.  Endless fields surround you on all
sides.  There is enough food here to feed a large city.
