{128}                               Savant Village
{308}
This area was created by Emperor in 1997. It is the mystical (and
protective) home of a cabal of scholars and their spiritual leader, the
Great Savant. They follow their studies in a devout, sometimes crazed
fashion. If you're interested, the word is that they are recruiting. Only
one way to find out...

You are taken back by the great age of the buildings in your vacinity.
Judging from the weight and size of some of the stone pillars, it seems
apparent that these structures were created in ancient times, when gravity
was rumored to be weaker. The architecture is flawless, perfectly
engineered.

You are suspended in space, your body twisted and turned beyond your
control. There is light, yet no source. There is no wind or weather, just
the substance of a nothingness you have never experienced.

A Small Shack~
You enter a small shack fashioned from logs and covered in snow. Small
jewels and beads hang from the walls, a thick rug covers the floor.
There is a small fire here, a few chairs and a wooden table. It seems to
be some sort of mountain refuge.

A Detention Cell~
Of the other cells, this one seems to be in the best condition. It is
newer than the others, though you can tell it has been tarnished by the
creatures walking around here.
