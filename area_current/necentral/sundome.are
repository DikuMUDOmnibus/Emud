{308}
The Sun Dome is located east from Ocean City.  It's a temple of Manwe founded
before the great Water/Air war and has been a sanctuary for Air followers ever
since.  A couple of years ago the old High Priest Toras died of ripe old age
and his son, Sa'ar, was elected as the new High Priest.~

Anauroch~
You're in the great Anauroch desert. Nothing grows here. There're dunes
everywhere and you occasionally sink in the sand. You should watch out for
quicksand, it is said to be deadly. The sun blazes mercilessly above your
head. You can see the edge of the desert to the west. You have a feeling
that you should leave this god-forsaken place.
