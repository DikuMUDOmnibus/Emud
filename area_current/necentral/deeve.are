The Deeve may be found by going north from the Cross-Roads, east of the
city.  This area is loosly based on the original area of Moria from the
Diku area base.  Be wary of the gargolith guarding the entrance.

Enjoy, Chaos.

The Incredibly Raunchy Smelling Area~
Upon entering this area, you immediately are able to place it.  You almost
gagg from the smell.  An indepth discussion of the nature of the smell would
almost assuredly include biology, morphology, microbology, necrology, and
scientology.

The smelly cave~
This room looks incredibly beautiful.  There is purple crystal stalagtites
and a clear running stream.  There are small pink crystals stuck to the ceiling
looking much like daisies.  Cute little, white lizards scamper among the
bright green stalagmite.  The only problem is you are about to puke from the
smell.
