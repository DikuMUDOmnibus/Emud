The Elven Empire has been ruled wisely for many years by its kings.  It
has been helped by many loyal nobles doing their part to make the Empire
run smoothly.  These elves are always looking for young elves to join the
empire and help them further the Empire throughout the realms.

Chara~
Chara looks expectantly at you.~
Chara is wearing a rose colored sundress with a white cotton apron tied
around it.  Her hands are callused attesting to the hard work that
country life brings.  Her countenance, however, leads you to believe
that her life is rewarding as well.

a girl~
A girl tries vainly to look older as she smiles.~
She looks to be about 13 and at the age that she wants to be a woman yet
is still a girl.  She is cute in her pigtails, but would prefer to wear
her hair long and free as young women do.

Cole~
Cole is here, working in the field.~
Cole is a strong looking man.  His face is weathered and taunt from the
years of working outside but his greeting is cheerful and his handshake
firm.  He is clad in overalls and a long sleeved shirt.  In this heat,
you'd think that long-sleeves would be a bother, but they must protect
his arms from the stalks.

Hector stands here solemnly.~
Hector seems to be eccentric in that his clothing does not match and he
has various gadgets hanging from his clothing.  He can't seem to stand

Chapter 3 Legend
Most of the knowledge of the Sithi died out centuries ago, but what
little remains states that the Sithi imbibed objects with vast power and
after the Great War, many of these objects were destroyed to keep the
each other from having it.  What may be legend or may be a clue is that
the city of Ascarle was destroyed by a great tidal wave and still
sits under the sea.  An object of great power is rumored to be hidden
there and would be of great value to either race: Drow or Elves.

great war~
Chapter 2 The Great War
When Chaos first came to the land and fought his terrible battle with
Order, several of the Sithi were turned.  They chose the path of
disharmony, which eventually led to the evolution of two distinct types
of Sithi which were the terms Elf and Drow.  Elf represented beauty,
light, order and intelligence.  Drow represented cunning, dexterity,
chaos and darkness. Over multiple generations, the knowledge of Sithi
died out and the two types merged into distinct races.
~

history~
Chapter 1 History
Modern elf society began after the rift with what we commonly call Drow
or dark elves occurred.  Before that both races were part of the same
culture and were known as Sithi.  As a people, the Sithi, were long
lived, in tune with nature and in touch with their spiritual selves.
They were the best rangers and magic users of any living creature and
legend states that though very naive, the Sithi were very powerful
because of the immense knowledge they shared.  Communication between the
Sithi was a common thought process in which one could think at a
specific person or the group as a whole.

The wind whipping forcefully through the waving grain, lining the roadside
gives a musical almost ethereal scream to the air.  The land itself seems to

power stems from abundant life and your tongue is thick with the taste of it.

Glass doors protect the stairs from the weather yet allow an uninhibited

with the flowers.

The garden is even lovelier now that you've entered within.  The smells are
