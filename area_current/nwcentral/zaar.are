{128}                 -- {118}Monastery of {178}Zaar {118}Mountain {128}--
{068}
This as you can see is a joint area written based on monks as the title of
the area shown.  This area was started at the urging of a good friend of
ours and basically it involves the apprenticeship into monkhood. Our idea
is no one is born a monk.  One has to learn what it takes to be a monk and
meanings behind it. (If you explore this area closely, you will notice a
few "things" are a close parody of the eastern monastery found in the real
world. However, most ideas are obtain from our imagination. :) As for the
quests, you can only attempt them ONCE in your life time. If you fail, you
will have to reincarnate again.  Like any ambitious creators, we have a
very long and interesting storyline.  We only hope that you, as the main
character of this story will enjoy this area. Have fun! :)

{308}
         Time is but a name, a counter perhaps for mortals such as us.
         What are years to us in the realms of the mortal?  I know not
         of its true meaning.  Nevertheless I do know this, as tyranny
         rises, and so do the champions. I am just one of the many who
         comes when the oppressed needs me and fades whenever peace
         resides.  I require no name as I will not wealth.  So let me
         be free of name as a bird is free of cage.

{308}
Well, if you come this far to read this, we would be more than glad to give
you some tips (and our opinions) as a bonus. However, to what extend these
tips are true, it's for you to judge as you are ultimately responsible for
yourself.

     1. Never make the mistake of killing anything you see as this is
        probably the last command you'll ever type.
     2. Be observant.  We spent considerable amount of time on minute
        details for your sake.  So we only ask that you do the same
        for us.
     3. Listen carefully to what is said as their language is bad and
        you will have to understand this new form of language.

{068}
This area had some polishing but shouldn't be too much different from
the original version.  Programs are more efficient now and I tried
to fix every part that would leave the quester bit screwed, though
I'm not 100% sure I got them all.  Let me know if any problems occur.

Abbot~
Abbot YatTang~
Abbot YatTang is resting here.~
You can tell from the looks of him that he is a man of great knowledge and
spirit. His presence makes you feel safe and secure. Like every monk you see
in this monastery, he always greet you courteously and smiled benevolently
whenever you approached him. From the look of his eyes, you can tell that he
will not hesitate to answer any questions you ask. He is currently meditating,
kneeling on top of a golden lotus dais. In his hands, held a bead necklace,
where he kept chanting something that's beyond your understanding.

From a glance, you can tell that this is just an ordinary monk.  However, you
notice that despite doing simple chores such as sweeping, this monk seemed to
be in total concentration of his job.  Not until you tap on his shoulder that
he knew that you are there.  He smiled at you broadly and bow before you. He
wish your journey to be fruitful and success in whatever you do. With that he
went back to concentrate on his sweeping again.

A Monk is here cooking.~
One look at him you can see that he's HUGE compared to the other monks you saw
in this monastery.  He is over seven feet tall and lord his arms are as big as
your thighs!  Whenever you are in his way, he would smile at you jovially.  At
times when it seems that he would knock you down, he would avoid that with cat
like agility.  As you observe him a little longer, you notice that every dish
he prepares is meticulous in detail and exquisite by nature.  You are indeed
very surprised by the fact that such coarse and huge hands could produce
gourmet that befits an emperor.

that the force is preventing you from getting too near to him no matter how
hard you tried.  He smiled and nodded knowingly at your dilemma, telling you
to fear not.  He sat back onto his chair and telepathically told you that
that's how he helps people practice. As an after thought, he hope that you
would not mind this kind of unorthodox teachings.

Monk~
the monk~
A monk is here sweeping diligently.~
From a glance, you can tell that this is just an ordinary monk.  However,
you notice that despite doing simple chores such as sweeping, this monk
seemes to be in total concentration of his job.  Not until you tap on his
shoulder that he knew that you are there.  He smiles at you broadly and bows
before you.  He wishes your journey to be fruitful and success in whatever
you do.  With that he goes back to concentrate on his sweeping again.

A very handsome and regal looking lady is here.~
You see a tall, beautiful and regal looking lady here. She has silky long
black hair.  Whenever she turned her head, her hair would sway as freely,
and naturally as when gentle breeze caress a willow tree.  Her every move
is as graceful as a snow white swan. Her dark brown eyes sparkled like stars
in a cloudless nights, and when you look into them, it's like looking through
a window with a breathtaking and tranquil scenery.  You are totally lost in
her eyes.  And whenever she looks at you quizically, her beautiful and gentle
face overwhelmes you with a peculiar sense of being completely engulfed in
love.  You can't even began to coherently describe her smile.  It is as
bright as day, and as warm, and sweet as a mug of hot chocolate in an endless
winter night.  You are awed by the fact that such a celestially beautiful
being can exist and thrive in a world as cruel as this.  As she is giggling,
you can only stare at her dumbfounded, wishing that she is the only reason
of your existance.

that the tail feathers are made of gems of assorted colors and hue. It seems
that this whole picture is based primarily on the collage method. Try as you

You are appalled at the imensity and the details of the phoenix. You also
noticed that there is a pearl-like sphere, which is on fire, which is in
between it's beak. The phoenix's eyes are so striking that one look at them
send waves of chilling feelings down your spine. You hope that you will not
ever meet such magical and enchanting creature, for it will probably
destroy you.

Little Forest~
You are at a little forest. This seems to be the place where firewood are
collected. Only a few trees are in this area. Most are young and some of
them are old and dying. You can hear birds resting on top of tree
branches and whistling a fine tune.

Storeroom~
As soon as you entered this room you find that there's something peculiar
about it. The room is well lit, and spacious. A gentle and yet euphoric
perfume smell permeate the air, which is mildly nudging you, teasing your
every senses. Every item you see in this room are well placed and neatly
juxtaposed. The floor is so clean that you could see your own reflection.
There's not even a speck of dust found anywhere. Though the furniture you
found is of antique in nature, they are extremely well kept and taken care
of. Wherever you glance, you'll see little pots of strange but very
beautiful flowers and plants, as if this is the house of a famous florist.
You are intrigue as of who might be the owner of this little heaven on
earth.
