{308}
Gahld is a small kingdom located somewhere on the north west part of the
main continent.  It is rumored a decrepit old castle where the king once
lived can be found there.  But a disastrous catastrophy killed every
living creature in the kingdom centuries ago.  Ever since no living
creature has dared to return since the castle is inhabitted by the
ghosts of its long dead owners and creatures of evil.

On the north wall~
The wind is harsh and cold atop the castle's rock wall.  From this point you can
see the majority of the surrounding areas.  The city of Midgaard is to the
west, a large river flows through it.  To the north the land gets hilly, and you
think you can see a large shrine on the eastern face of one of the larger
hills.  Woods surround the Castle on all sides except this one.  A large field
is immediately north and you can look down upon the ant-like beings crawling
across it.  To the immediate east are a range of hills which lead into yet
another forest.

On the east wall~
The wind is harsh and cold atop the castle's rock wall.  The city of Midgaard
is to the west, a large river flows through it.  To the north the land gets
hilly, almost mountainous.  Woods dominate the area just below this wall.
Although you can see some traces of what looks to be a swamp beginning to
the south.

Top of northwest tower~
You never realized how quaint the city looks from this high.  Of course,
specific details are lacking...but you choose to ignore this fact.  This area
looks like it could be easily defended.

The armory~
You have entered a long-unused armory.  All the weapons here have rusted away
long ago.  Only something preserved by magic could still be usable.

You have entered a long, low room carpeted with a layer of red dust.  Many
racks line the walls and appear to have held various instruments of war, but
now they are empty.

Order's private workshop~
This workshop is placed in the middle of nowhere so Order can get away from it
all (whatever that is).  A nice, big fireplace covers the entire eastern wall.
