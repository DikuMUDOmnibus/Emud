>speech_prog knights~
say So you want to know about the Knights of Virtue...
say well they were a group of noble and fierce knights.
say They fought for King Akron on his many quests.
say The knights consisted of Sir Gallant, Sir Windel,
say Maiden Avery, Sir Voren and Sir Valis.  Sadly they all
say perished in the war of High Magic. They now await for
say the chosen one to bring them back to glory.
~
>speech_prog castle~
say Akron's castle lies near the northern most part of
say Roterodamum.  The area is highly dangerous and rumors
say say the castle is cursed.  An ancient vampire is said
say to inhabit the castle. Last I've heard the fiendish
say creature was called Bloodsoul.
~
>speech_prog akron~
say Yes, Akron was once the greatest warrior of Mortal
say Realms.  He possessed uncanny ability for a mortal.
say It is said his armor gave him powers beyond of any
say mortal man.  It is truly sad for him to of perished
say in the war of High Magic.
~
>speech_prog armor~
say Armor? ah yes, I do believe what you are asking
say is the Armor of Fate.  Many years ago Akron defeated
say the demonic forces of Azeroth.  In doing so he was
say granted by the gods to wear the Armor of Fate.  The
say gods allowed Akron to bear the armor because of his
say faith and devotion for the cause of good.  The armor
say consisted of four parts.  Unfortunately all four parts
say was lost in the battle of High Magic.  His body never
say found, and his Armor of Fate scattered all around Mortal
say Realms.  It would be wise to search his castle for any
say clues on the Armor of Fate for it holds the key to
say enter Plains of Magic.
~
>speech_prog plains~
say The Plains of Magic is a haven of powerful magic.
say The grounds for which manna is generated and stored
say in catastrophic proportions.  For whom ever controls
say the Plains of magic controls the Storms of Time.  For
say eons, Akron and his Knights roamed the realms to gather
say powerful forces of magic to protect the plains.  Only
say one bearing the Armor of Fate can enter and allow his
say fellow knights to follow him through the portal to holy
say grounds.  As we speak the hordes of Azeroth has already
say breached the inner sanctum of the holy grounds.  How
say they entered, I do not know, but what I do know is if
say they are not stopped I fear we are all doomed!
~
>speech_prog war~
say The war of High Magic is where the Knights of Virtue
say perished along with their King.  The battle was over
say Unknown the control for the Plains of Magic.  Though it is said
say Azeroth perished in the hands of Akron many years ago,
say that is not so.  He has since reincarnated and become
say more powerful.  His hordes of demonic creatures crushed
say the forces of Akron.  No one escaped his wrath.
say Azeroth's forces march forward to the Plains of Magic
say as we speak.  There is not much time left.  Seek the
say Unknown Armor of Fate if you are truly the chosen one my
say brother, for it is your only access to the Plains of
say Magic and our only hope of stopping Azeroth.

made of the finest ivory.  It still gleams of its glory when it was first built
by the finest dwarven masonry.  As you step closer to the entrance of the tomb a

Hall of Courage.~
As you walk into the hallway of Courage you feel an aura of righteousness.
Your body tingles as you glare at the tombs of fellow knights who have
perished in the battle field to fight for what they believed in.  You now
see the symbols clearly on the walls and on the floor.  Before you make
another move a little girl comes rushing out from the northern hallway.
She is screaming, TROLL! TROLL! TROLL!

As you walk into the hallway of Honor you feel an aura of righteousness.
Your body tingles as you glare at the tombs of fellow knights who have
perished in the battle field to fight for what they believed in.  You now
see the symbols clearly on the walls and on the floor.  You notice the tombs
in this room are particularly alluring.  The tombs here are coated with
gold and laced with silver on the sides.  The tombs here are easily accessed.
Not allot of protection was put into this room.  You wonder what could be
inside besides the corps?  Before you attempted to open the tomb you
see something sparkle northward.  The path leads you North and South.

As you walk into the hallway of Virtue you feel an aura of righteousness.
Your body tingles as you glare at the tombs of fellow knights who have
perished in the battle field to fight for what they believed in.  You now
see the symbols clearly on the walls and on the floor.  A shrine sits at
the northern end of the tomb.  You see a cloaked person standing before
the shrine looking at something very carefully!

On the shrine are two lit candles.  Between the candles there is a book.
You figure the text must be of some ancient language.  Upon closer inspection
you notice you are able to read the text.

E
book~
You open the book and start scanning the pages to look for anything that
may be of use:

 Honor: Respect those that came before you, if honor is what you value.

 Courage: Courage sometimes comes in material objects giving us strength.

 Justice: Justice is in us all, for only those that that live by it know its
          purest form.

 Truth: Though shall never lie or steal if one is a true Knight!

 You can only ponder the value of these words of wisdom?

Hall of Truth.~
As you walk into the hallway of Truth you notice it is pilled mile high
with treasure.  The treasure must go all the way to the ceiling.  You see
ancient artifacts and scrolls of wisdom just left here to gather dust.
Gold coins from every type of civilization has been stored here from the
journeys of the knights of virtue.  On a closer inspection you see that
the rarity in this room can bring you much fortune if you were to bring
it back and sell it at Chakkor.  With just the treasure in this room, it
be possible to buy all the recall scrolls you ever dreamed of!  The path
leads you north.

Hall of Courage.~
Upon entering this room you detect the smell of death.  Corps lie scattered
all around you.  You puke at the site of mutilated flesh and half eaten body
parts.  The troll has gone through all the tombs and desecrated them,
probably searching for food.  There is blood all over the walls covering the
symbols.  Using your keen sense of detection you see foot prints of this
hideous troll going north.  Judging from the size of the tracks you estimate
the troll to stand at least 12 feet tall and weighing around 900 pound.  You
can only wonder how the girl escaped the wrath of this vile beast.  Before
you enter you hear a howling scream echoing down the hallways which makes you
step back a few.  You are beginning to wonder if it is worth going north at
all after hearing such a spine chilling sound.

YOU HAVE FOUND THE MOTHER LOAD!  This is probably the biggest section of
the whole tomb!  Now you know why this tomb is so huge!  The glare in this
room is so strong that you cannot even keep your eyes open.  As you open
your eye's slowly you notice this room is filled with jewels.  Mounds and
mounds of treasure has been left here by the knights.  You must feel pretty
good just about now.  After completing the Courage and Honor test you dam
straight deserve all this gold!  As you sift through all the gold you
can only wonder the endless possibilities that can be achieved with all this
gold.  In your amazement you see a shimmering glow to the north.  There must
be more gold up ahead.  You gather what you can and start heading north.
You can barely hold yourself as gold pours out of your sleeves and greaves.

Again this room makes you puke in disgust.  Dead body parts lie everywhere.
This whole section of the tomb smells like rotting corps.  You see blood
everywhere covering the symbols.  The tombs have been desecrated and treasure
looted.  You notice some munching noises in the corner.  As you approach
the source of the noise you see the troll in a crouched position eating of
what was the remains of a corps.  It don't look very appetizing to you as
you get closer to the vile beast.

Nothing.  Your only path leads you West and East.  Heading East would take
