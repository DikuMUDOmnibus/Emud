Mountainside Tombs~
There are a few stone heaps here and there, the tombs of those who did not
last the arduous journey up the mountain.  Curiously you notice a few
uncovered bodies which don't seem to have died of exhaustion.  The path curves
east around the mountain.

A Blind Curve on the Mountain Path.~
This looks like a normal mountain path, but it is NOT!  This section of the

Vista~
This is a stunning vista overlooking a canyon.  There is a sign here that says:

	BEHOLD -- ELEMENTAL CANYON

Fire leaps up from firepits in the western part of the canyon.  The sky looks
funny, and the air seems hazy to the northwest.  Electricity sparks
intermittently in the northeast.  To the east you see a strong, magic-looking
river flowing through the canyon.  Also to the east you spy a cave entrance
leading into the canyon wall.  The path descends to the north to another
overlook.

northwest are outcrops which rise up from the canyon floor. To the east there
is a cave mouth which leads into the canyon wall.  And to the south the path
leads up, away, and out of the canyon.  Various pure and cross-breeds of
