{138}                                Gnomedell Village{388}

The village of Gnomedell can be found in the southeast portion of the central
continent. Despite being the main route to the mysterious Alchemist's Workshop,
there is little traffic through this area. From what little you've heard of the
place, it seems that the gnomes of the village have spent years in minor
skirmishes with the hobgoblins living in some nearbye caves.

This update only adds one small quest to this area, for some low level damage
equipment. One of the quest rewards has a nice side-effect as well ;-)

This area was originally the stock area of Gnome Village with very little going
for it. The equipment was lousy, the creatures gave no experience, and there was
no quest. This update is designed to allow for some lowbie levelling and a few
pieces of fairly decent equipment.
