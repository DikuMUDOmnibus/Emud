The area is called refuge tribe. It is the first area I have ever made, so
comments are welcome and please finger lele for my e-mail address.  English is
my second language so don't tell me if you find some spelling errors or grammar
mistakes; I won't spend time to correct them. I think this area is pretty...
ahem... good.

                                    Story
{308}
As mentioned by Hiho in his book, all the residents here are originally 
refugees from the Kingdom of Dilemma. They fled because they were all
peace-loving people. After a thousand years of development, the tribe had
become one of the most advanced and populated cities in the realms. That
caught Demise's attention and he sent out troops to burn down this peaceful
city.  However, the military leader of the village, C. Slayer, with the help
of Gaia, was able to save the town from Demise's troops of destruction. This
time, Demise sent out yet another troop of minions who were determined to
destroy the whole city. If they should fail the mission, they would make sure
the two leaders of the town, Hiho and Slayer, were killed.

Now at this critical time, a hero walked through the gate.... YOU!! The
future of this city is now up to you. Can you save it?

                                  Equipment
{308}
There is eq for low and high level players in Refuge Tribe. For high level
players there are two sets of armor and weapons that have the same stats.
I just think this mud doesn't have much good armors for evil people so I
made the evil armors more easy to get. Although all high level eq is unique,
you have to go through a quest to get the good armor. For the evil armor you
just go in and kill the boss.

                                   Quests
{308}
There are several little quests in the village:

1) Rob the bank and get cash and some cool equipment.
2) Get Slayer out of the safe room so you can kill him.
3) The easiest quest probably will be this one. Find a good piece of iron and
   let Porky the blacksmith make some equipment for you.
4) Get a cool enchanted rune of magical ability.
5) Get the shopkeeper to show you the black market.

This is the Refuge Tribe's village. Me, Hiho alone with Slayer brought
our people here a thousand years ago. Most people now don't remember their
roots and why their ancestors came to this place. We called this place
Refuge Tribe because we were all refugees from The Kingdom of Dilemma, a
place not suitable for most people to live in. The magic users and the
fighters in the kingdom formed their own groups fighting all day to prove
who was the most powerful in the kingdom and even the world. It's rumored
that both groups have something powerful enough to destroy the other and
no one dared to use them. Any outsiders, who can gain trust from them and
get to keep that secret weapon, will be almost matchless.
