{308}
Tanglewood forest is a area easily found when traveling eastwards after passing
the east gate of Roterodamum.  Though the forest might seem peaceful at first
sight the forest creatures are in grave danger, and might need your help to
overcome the evil tidings.

the Forest Ranger~
A Forest Ranger stands here.~
His hair is longer than you'd expect, and dark.  His keen grey eyes are guarded,
although a faint smile plays over his lips.  He wears dark leather armor, and a
longsword is resting lightly in his hand.

You're walking through the forests of Tanglewood.  Dead leaves crunch under your
feet, and the wind whistles ominously through the trees.  The air is crisp and
sharp with the scent of moss and plants.  You can see, looking ahead, that the
forest ends in a clearing to the east.

A Clearing~
You find yourself standing in the middle of a sun-dappled forest clearing.
There is an abundance of flowers and plants dotting the landscape.  Turning in a
lazy circle you see trees surrounding you in each direction.  Far beyond and
above the trees, a mountain range is just visible to the north.

... or some thing ... rather large.
