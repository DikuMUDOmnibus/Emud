All kinds of magical items line the shelves of this small shop.  Some
look plain, some look powerful, and some just look gaudy.  Frantic activity
can be heard from the north and west.

Honest Bob's Office.~
The entire first floor of this large office building is Honest Bob's
office.  Artifacts from all over the world decorate the walls.  None of the
artifacts seem to be very valuable, although you can't quite identify the
origen of some of them.  At one end of this huge room is a large oak desk.
Behind the desk, on one corner, is a spiral staircase leading up and down.
You get the creepy feeling that someone is watching you, even though you are
the only one in the room.
	Someone has left a note one the desk.

Honest Bob's Bedroom~
This room has been lavashly decorated as Bob's bedroom.  Untold riches
lie before you.  As you once again get that creepy feeling of being watched,
you begin to think that Bob would be very upset if he caught you rummaging
through his stuff.  Who knows what he would do to you.

Honest Bob's Warehouse~
You are in a HUGE cavern that Honest Bob has turned into a warehouse.
Thousands of crates are stacked here, and they barely fill a third of the
cavern!  You begin to get the idea that trading directly with Bob is a losing
proposition.

The Squid Pens~
Several large tanks filled with squid of all sizes are in this room.
A group of very large squid are playing catch between their tanks.  As you
walk in, you distract the squid.  One of them misses, and their ball rolls
towards you.  Just before it rolls out the door, you notice a bloodied chef's
hat sticking to it.
