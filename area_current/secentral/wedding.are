Sinner~
The secretary is here setting behind a wooden desk.~
The glorious portrait of that Angel's face'
Made to amaze weak men's confused skill,
And this world's worthless glory to embase,
What pen, what pencil, can express her fill?

Before The Wedding Chapel~
You are standing in a small square in front of a high mountain. To the
east there is a small building with a little sign over a door. To the west
there is a nice little Inn where probably hust married people go to enjoy the
pleasures of being married. On the northern side of the square stands wall of
natural white marble. The whole mountain side has been carved forming a
beatiful temple front facade. It looks like some kind of very ancient temple.
There two braziers to show the entrance to the temple but the light doesnt
allow you to see what's inside. Something has been printed on the floor.

exactly you need to do. This area would have never been realized if I had not
received the help of many people. I want to thank them all here.
Thanx to Sinner, Panic, Redrum, Deadbolt, Ginger and my sister Barbara.

The Office of the Chapel~
This little office is perfectly tied up and clean; the walls are painted of a
pale pink and nailed all over them are the pictures of many couples who got
married in this tiny but efficient chapel. A couple of plants make this office
even nicer that it would be without. The largest part of the office is taken
by a big desk and a couple of armchairs where you should sit to talk about
your wedding.

The Wedding Temple~
Right after you entered this environment you see that it is a very particular
room. A magically lit fire ring defines a round area where the biggest bear
skin carpet lies in. The head of the animal is still attached and it is so
well mummified that it looks like it's sleeping. Over the bear skin there
are two carved wood armchairs covered with a thin layer of leather that must
have been made by a very skilled artisan. This two elegant chairs stand in
front of a stone table, actually the whole thing looks very much like an altar
room of some sort. You hear something roaring... You take a couple of steps
forward and you realize that in the back of the fire ring, in a part of the
temple you didnt notice before, there is an holy mountain tiger chained to
the rock wall. You hear a perpetual sound of cerimonial drums. A nice diamond
plaque is attached to the stone table. To the south lies the exit to the
temple.

Moonlight Cove Inn~
This is the inn where most of the people who get married in the chapel spent
their first night. It has no particular feature, it is made of wood and the
furnoture is a bit antique, but you like it anyhow. Probably you could think
of many other nice places where you could spend your first night of wedding.

The Honeymoon Suite~
WOW! Now you understand why a lot of people chose to exploit this place for
their honeymoon. This room is so comfortable that you wish nobody ever forces
you to leave this place. The bed is the classic heart-shaped model you usually
find in the postcards of hotels, it is covered with a warm, fluffy red blanket
and you feel a strong attraction to go under it with your partner. The roof is
totally made of glass so that you can watch the sunny sky in the day or a
beatiful and romantic moon at night. The west wall is actually a big window
opening on a large balcony. As you look out of it you are a little bit
surprised; you are staring at wonderful sunset on the ocean but for what you
know the ocean should be anywhere but west of here. You decide to stop
twisting your mind about these little magical tricks and fix your attention
on the warm and bubbling water filling the hot tub placed in the room. Yes!
You decide that you'll start your honeymoon taking a restoring bath into it.

This is the restaurant where a lot of people come to enjoy their wedding feast.
On the walls of this room are the portraits of those who ran the restaurant in
the past centuries. Here you can have home cooked-typical italian specialties
and you are sure that here the food will be better than anywhere else, but as
you look at the menu... hmmm... probably you already saw these things somewhere
else. You dont care about it and decide that you will eat whatever is given to
by the waiter.
