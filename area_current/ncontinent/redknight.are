This castle is home to an elite order of knights; The Red Knights.
You may join them if you wish, but you must complete a quest to earn
their trust.  Once a member of the red knights, you will gain several
friends and other bonuses inaccessible to non-members.  There is no
way out of the order once you become a member.
