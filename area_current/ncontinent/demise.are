{308}
The Temple of Demise was built after the Time of Creation.  According to the
legends a thousand slaves worked on it for a thousand years.  The temple is
a sanctuary for all Fire followers.  In its center one might be able to find
the High Priestess who has been given the powers to induct neutrals into the
ranks of Fire.
