{308}
Troll Island displays the true nature of trolls.  The island is a magical
place, where the trolls are not brutal and blood thirsty.  When trolls leave
the island, however, the forces that held them at bay no longer grip them,
and they become the living terrors that most people know them as.  The same
magic that keeps them from ripping your throat out on the island, is also the
same force that keeps them from turning to stone in sunlight.  Some people
believe that the troll king possesses the power to control the magic, and if 
he were to die, the trolls would become the evil most believe them to be.

Temple of the Trolls~
You find yourself walking around a beautiful temple.  It bears no sharp edges
or mis-shapen steps, as you might expect to find from the troll race.  Upon
examining the material used for the temple, you can, for the most part, see
a reflection of yourself in it, only you look more troll-like than anything
else.  The temple continues to the north.  Down you see the island.

You stand at the peak of the temple, and you get the breath-taking view of
the entire island.  Surrounding the island you can only see a mist-covered
sea, but the island is totally clear of mist, and all the lush greenery
makes you wish you lived here.  Stairs lead back down in all directions.
