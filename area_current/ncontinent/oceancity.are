{138}                                    Ocean City
{300}
This coastal city is situated on the Northern continent and is the gateway to
the rest of the landmass. The city has been historically associated with the
seafaring trades and as such there is a traditional tendency towards the worship
of Ulmo. Ocean City is useful as a base for exploring the rest of the continent,
with plenty of shops and guilds (and a morgue ;) to assist you in your
adventures. The city may be reached by Griffon Airlines or through the oceans to
the north of Ofcol.

{300}
There is only one 'proper' quest in the city which involves helping one of the
denizens discover what has happened to his missing daughter. You will be
rewarded with a nice light.

There are also several mini quests in this area. Some are just for fun, some
will result in a small reward.

{300}
This area was originally created by Presto almost ten years ago as a starting
point for the rest of the continent. With the advent of a multitude of lowbie
areas since then the equipment in this area has become obsolete. My revision is
designed to correct this. I have left most of the area design as it was so
finding your way around shouldn't be a problem.
