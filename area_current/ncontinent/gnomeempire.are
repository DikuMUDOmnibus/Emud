{308}
This area was designed to be the basis of the Gnome Empire, which consists of
every gnome who proves himself worthy to become a member.  In this area you'll 
find the central castle, all the shops and guilds which come with an empire, 
and you'll notice that this area has a particular restriction which you won't 
find elsewhere.  This area is for GNOMES OF THE EMPIRE ONLY!
