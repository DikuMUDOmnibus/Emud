The Forest~
The trees here are magnificent.  They're not only larger than the great
redwoods that you've heard legends about, they're also different shades
of the rainbow.  Some are quite impressive.  At night this forest would
have to be extremely dark.  Hopefully nothing out there lurks in shadows.

A Clearing~
You stand in a small clearing.  It feels good to see the sky again.
The air isn't as musty or wretched as in the forest either.
You see the forest to the north and south.

The Entrance to the Forest~
This entrance is shocking.  In front of you lie the widest variety of
trees in the world.  They're all extremely tall.  You can see that
further into the forest it gets a lot darker.  At night you better have
a light source if you wish to survive.  The forest is south.  There is
a small clearing to the east.

The Land of Not~
You enter a clearing.  To the west you see enormous trees.  They even have
bark of different shades of the rainbow.  To the east of you is the 
residential road of Ocean City.  There is a sign staked in the clearing here.
