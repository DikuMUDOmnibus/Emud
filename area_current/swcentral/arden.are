{308}
The Amber Region consists of:

Forest of Arden and Mount Kolvir

I make no claim of originality for these areas. All the ideas come from the
Chronicles of Amber novels by Roger Zelazny. Also in the course of creating
these areas I have made reference to the Amber Role Playing Game by Erick
Wujcik and The Visual Guide to Castle Amber by Zelazny and Neil Randall.
Anyone who enjoyed this area, I encourage you to go out and find the books.
They are fascinating reading.

Forest of Arden~
You have entered the majestic Forest of Arden! One-hundred foot tall trees
stand all around you as far as the eye can see. The colors and texture of this
beautiful wood somehow seem more vibrant than any place you've ever been in
your life. There is little undergrowth that you can see. Just as you begin to
relax, the chilling sound of baying hounds fills the air! The forest continues
to the east, while the slope below you fades into the shadows.

a large pavillion is set to the south. A pennant flying from the top of the
pavillion bears the standard of a striking hawk.

Lost in the Forest~
This area of the forest does seem different from the rest. To the south you
can continue to search through the forest. More intriguing though is a small
cave mouth that opens up to the east.

Lair~
Maybe you shouldn't have investigated this place after all. It appears to be
the lair of some very smelly animals. You can beat a hasty retreat to the west
or continue farther into the cave to the south.

Hellhound Lair~
Now you know you should have gotten out. This appears to be a breeding ground
for those nasty hellhounds! You can leave through the north.
