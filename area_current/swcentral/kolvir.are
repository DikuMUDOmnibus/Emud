manticore~
the manticore~
A manticore prowls around here looking for Amberites to eat.~
The manticore has the body of a lion, with reptilian wings and a long,
scorpion-like stinger tail. Despite its human head, there is little
intelligence in the manticore's eyes. It snarls at you angrily.

the werewolf soldier~
One of Corwin's werewolfs is here looking for an enemy to shoot.~
Prince Corwin recruited this soldier from a far off shadow where the dominant
humanoid species was canine. Consequently he looks like a werewolf.
The soldier is holding an extremely odd missile weapon in his hands.

the shapeshifter of entropy~
A shapeshifter from the Courts of Entropy is here trying to destroy Amber.~
It is hard to guess the natural shape of this entity because it keeps
changing. One moment it resembles something demonic, the next a pillar of
fire, and then changing again into a grotesque blob. It is never the same
form twice, but every shape is deadly.

Some vines are about to rise up out of the grass and attempt to
squeeze you to death!~
It is hard to concentrate on looking at the grass when you are slowing
being crushed, but you can see that the vines have somehow been animated
by the cursed power of the black road. They are very strong and are
attempting to pull you down to the ground so they can strangle you.

Prince Eric of Amber is here making a final stand against the forces of
Entropy.~
Eric is a handsome man with blue-black hair and beard. Even in the midst of
what could be his final battle, he grins and shouts challenges to his enemies.
He is dressed simply in a leather jacket and leggings, a plain cloak and
boots. A red sword belt is clasped around his waist and a pair of black scale
gloves hang from it. He seems superbly confident of his abilities.

Road to Amber~
You are walking along the road to the great city of Amber. It is a wide, paved
road that seems well used even in these troubled times. When you look down at
your feet, you notice glowing runes warding the path from danger. Perhaps it
would be better not to leave the road...
The road leads east and west, but the land to the south seems passable.

     A sign hangs in mid-air in front of you and refuses
     to get out of your way until you have read it once.

notice that it isn't actually a road but a long strip of land where all the

Vine street~
This is Vine street, where all of the richest and most powerful of Amberites
make their residence. A huge mansion lies on the south side of the road,
but its gates are closed and locked. To the north is a large and expensive
looking hotel. Intersections with other streets lie to the east and west.

Intersection~
You have come to the place where Vine street changes direction and where
Death Alley begins. This intersection isn't as busy, both because there is
little of interest on this end of Vine street and because bad things can
happen to people who get too close to Death Alley. You make a mental note to
yourself that Death Alley is east of here. Therefore you should stay on Vine
which leads west and south.

Bloody Bill's~
You are standing in the middle of a rough looking bar. The bar has a
particularly long and violent history. The last owner was named Bill and the
restaurant was at that time called Bloody Sam's. After Bill was stabbed to
death, his cousin Andy took over the place and renamed it Bloody Bill's.
This tragic pattern has occurred many times... nobody remembers what the
original name of the bar used to be. Despite this the bar consistently serves
the best seafood in Amber.

This is Vine street, where all of the richest and most powerful of Amberites

You are standing in entrance hall to the Temple of the Unicorn. Although the

you that the general population of Amber is a little too cynical to be highly
devoted to any religion. The sanctuary of the temple is located to the south.
    There is a podium here supporting a large guest book.

Why would Oberon sleep here though when the palace is only a mile away? The
place is extremely comfortable but is also hideously expensive. A stairway
leads up to the hotel rooms, but payment must be in advance.
