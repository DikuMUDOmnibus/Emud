{308}
The area has been designed, developed with the help of D&D Monster Manual.
I have been told to give credit to them and I did. Many of the mobs in the
area cast nasty spells when fighting, some of them are a bit tough so be
careful about what you do. The whole area supports one long quest to get a
quite powerful item. Hope you appreciate my work.

{308}
Long time ago dragons were the ruling race in te Realms, they were the
ones defending the Lords. This until the greatest war between the elements
almost led to the extition of the dragon race. The examplars who managed to
survive retired from the battle. Evil dragons established their domain into
a tower that is well known by the majority of living beings, while lawful
dragons decided to hide themself in a secret place to restore their power
and to get ready for the next war. In the meanwhile the Lords, who lost their
army of dragons, started recruiting among the lesser races almost forgetting
about dragons. Realizing that there was no need anymore to get ready for a
war, lawful dragons transformed their secret refuge into a shining town. The
location of the the town was unknown for everyone, until Neptune managed to
locate its whereabouts, taking advantage of a period of weakness accused by
his ancestral enemies. The haven is now seriously threatened by a mighty
warrior, who received great powers by his master, sent there to destroy the
whole breed of lawful dragons.

the mixing of a potion using the blood of a vampire and making a dragon
drink this potion. If a dragon was never a proper gem his soul would be
caged into it giving the owner of this gem great powers.

The Italian Restaurant~
This is a rather characteristic local. There are several tables and on some
of them is sitting someone who is enjoying Fizzo's extremely well cooked
dishes and specialties... Everyone in the Restaurant is happy to be in here
and feel happy too since you are surrounded by so many nice people.
A big and mean looking man comes towards with a suspicious grin.
As he gets near he says 'LEAVE YOUR WEAPONS OUTSIDE THE RESTAURANT...
WE DONT WANT TROUBLES HERE... ;)'
As he said so he smiles and walks away. You think that it would be a
respectful act to this friendly people to go outside and drop weapons and
you do so...

The Main Hallway of the Golden Castle~
As you walk along the main hall of the castle, putting your dirty feet over a
wonderful carpet made of red silk, you are stunned by the light and the
beauty the reign inside the castle. Many windows made of colored glass let
the sunlight in transforming it in different colors. Far ahead of you you see
a big throne. Back to the west is the entrance to the castle.

The Throne Stage~
You walk on a couple of steps and find yourself on a large stage in the middle
of which stands a big throne surrounded by many kinds of trophys. The Throne
made of solid granite and has the size of a real giant but you wonder how comes
that you see no sign of big creatures around here. Everything is tied up and
the red carpet on which walk is perfectly clean.

Atop the Southeast Tower of the Golden Castle~
There is not much room on top of the tower. From here can see the whole world
of Mortal Realms. Midgaard, Chakkor, New Chakkor, Mist city, Pompeii, Elven
City, City of Entropy look really close to each other, but you know that the
roads that connect them are really long; you can also spot the feared Lost
Citadel in the distance to the east. The sight is so beatiful that you could
stay here more an entire day completely lost in this beatiful show of
creativity.

Hallway to Sorcerers Practice Room~
It's a big and large round hallway. A gallery limited by wonderful pink
marble columns, follows the wall; as you get a closer look you see that it is
completely covered by paintings showing big fights between dragons and some
of the greatest dragons who chose to be part of the illusionist's guild. The
bright light of the sun warms this big room emtering through a perfectly
constructed glass vault.

The Sorcerers Practice Room~
The room is actually totally burned by failed spells casted by newbie
illusionists. You wonder how the dome is still standing on these damaged
colums. At the center of the room stands your guildmaster envoloped by a force
shield to protect himself from his adepts.

The Dome over the Well of Souls~
You walked into this large hall through the secret passage into the throne.
In the middle of it there is a small well from where you can hear the cries
of many soul who havent found peace after their death yet. This place makes
feel uncomfortable...
