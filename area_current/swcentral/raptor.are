                                Raptor Island
{308}
Raptor Island somehow never evolved through the ancient ages as most other
areas throughout the Realms. As a result, it is home to creatures of a
sort that cannot be found elsewhere. There are rumors that the area has
been used as a refuge for pirates and their stolen booty. Others claim it
is a safe harbor for all sea-going vessels and should not be feared.

  This area was originally created by Grim.

  Revised by Emperor on January 4th, 1998.

You are standing at the top of what seems to be a stairway carved out of
the rock leading to the darkness below.  Although crude it appears too
uniform to have been created naturally.

You see a gigantic carvern filled with water.  You see where this hidden

be an excellant place to hide a boat just as you look south and see a
docked pirate ship, apparently someone else had that idea too.  The
singing and cursing of drunken pirates reaches your ears.
