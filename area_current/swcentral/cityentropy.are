You  are in an underground cavern. To the west, a river flows out of a
small hole in the surrounding stone. The river widens to fill the whole
cavern to the east. The current is flowing very strongly from the west so
it is possible only to climb up to the roads of the realm, or jump on
a boat and head east.

You look up and realise that it is impossible to get back up the waterfall.
The sheer volume and ferocity of the water crashing down around you
prohibits even the use of a fly spell. To continue on the river is suicide.
