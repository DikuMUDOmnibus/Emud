A Lair~
As you enter this big lair you sense a strange sensation of
tranquillity. You are surronded by smoke a fog; you feel a living
presence even if you can't see a thing.

The Platform of Cold Lava~
This seems to be the lair for a community you have never seen before;
probably they love the heat of lava but they dont like the light of
the sun. Their nests are all around here and you can see the path made
by an old lava river that flowed to the south.

A Nest~
The platform of cold lava here has little cracks in it; you see
hot flowing lava through them and toxic gasses coming out. Little
volcanoes spit small drops of lava. Strange creatures seem to
have established their nest here.

The crust of cold lava here melted due to the heat of the lava pit
that lies down here. If you want to go on you have to dive into lava.
This place is really hot.

You are on the edge of cliffs over a big lava lake. In the middle
of the lake a small rock island emerges from the lava. You can get
