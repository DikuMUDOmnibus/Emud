                               Wyvern's Tower
{308}
This tower, situated west of Roterodamum, was once occupied by a garrison from
a long gone civilisation.  At some time in the past, though, it was destroyed
and then inhabited by a great wyvern.  As time passed both evil and good
creatures have come to live in and about the tower.
