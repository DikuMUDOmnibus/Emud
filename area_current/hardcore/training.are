{120}
     The Tower of Training is the place where new adventurers would try
     to kill their first mob,  or get killed for the very first time by
     one.   The first tip that you will get from this help file is:  do
     not rush into leveling, but take your time to read the help files.
     Read all the room description carefully, and learn to use the help
     command. If you're still confused, ask people for help, but try to
     find things out for yourself before you ask someone else for help.

     Type HELP without an argument to enter the help menu. While in the
     help menu you can type  a  b  c  d  e  etc to choose from the menu
     options. Typing any non listed menu option will make you leave the
     help menu.

the gargoyle~
There is a Gargoyle here seeking revenge against his captors.~
You enter and are immediately confronted by an enormous creature whose skin
appears to be made of stone.  You can see that his talons are long, sharp and,
unquestionably, tipped in blood!  You may wish to consider whether you are truly
ready to fight this gargantuan.  If not, now would be a good time to FLEE ...
unless you wish to suffer the consequences!

the gold drakeling~
There is a gold drakeling whizzing around the room.~
This is a smaller drakeling, a fire-breathing lizard with scales of pure gold! 
Its wings are rose-colored and leathery, and although they look fragile, they
flap powerfully.  It looks more than a bit dangerous and you jump as you see a
slender flame snake out of its mouth.  As it flies around your head you can see
that there are some items draped about its neck that could be of some use to
you.

There is a small pixie fluttering about the room.~
The pixie is a small, female warrior.  Though tiny in stature she appears
dangerous in attitude.  Short, shining blonde hair caps her tiny head, and her
eyes are a glittering emerald green.  Her iridescent wings flutter and gleam in
the dim light.  She holds a miniature dagger at her waist and narrows her eyes
at your approach.

There is a worm from the plane of Avernus slithering right toward you!~
This worm from hell is huge ... at least six feet long and a foot around!  As it

Its mouth gapes open as it slithers towards you, but you stand your ground. 
Why?  You've noticed some important pieces of equipment mired in its slimy body.

The kobold is short, roughly the height of a human child, with greyish skin,
large, pointed ears and the face of an ugly dog.  It is wearing whatever armor
it has managed to scrounge from around the Tower.  Second-hand armor, yes, but
it would still be of good use to you.  Don't let it's small size deceive you ...
this is a dangerous opponent.  The kobold mutters at you as you enter, its
beady, black eyes fixed on your weapon.

BIG enough for him!  He is powerfully built and stands in the middle of the

pale, ivory skin.  You can sense the pure power radiating from this Avatar, and
you feel her desire to heal and protect you through her spells.  A deep love of
Fire dwells within her heart.

statue~
the stone statue~
A noble statue stands proud upon a pedestal.~
The plaque which used to bear the name for this statue has been eroded by time,
but time has not yet had its way with the statue itself.  It stands proud and
noble, a figure captured in the prime of life.  As you stare, it seems almost
lifelike.  Was that a flicker of light in one grey eye?

Welcome to combat training.

The first lesson is knowing whom to fight.  Use the command {178}CONSIDER{078} to
consider killing a monster.  Avoid fighting monsters that will kill you
easily.

The second lesson is running away.  There is a monster in the room west.
He is too strong for you to kill, but he won't kill you.  So go {178}WEST{078} from
here, then {178}CONSIDER{078} him, then {178}KILL{078} him.  After a while, type {178}FLEE{078} to
escape from him.

You can also set your character to flee automatically with the {178}WIMPY{078}
command. Type {178}HELP WIMPY{078} to find out more about wimpy.

After you flee, you will be back in this room.  Don't worry, the wall of
force will keep the creature from following you. When you are ready to go on
to the next station, go {178}DOWN{078}.

{078}The avatars of the Training Tower have summoned some monsters for you to kill.
In the four force cages are four monsters of various types.  Kill them all.

To attack the first monster in the room use {178}K{078} this is short for {178}KILL{078}.
If you want to attack a more specific target use {178}KILL TARGET{078} where target is
at least the first 2 letters of the monster's name.

After you kill a monster you will automatically {178}SACRIFICE{078} the corpse, equipment
held by the monster will fall from the corpse into the room. You can pick up
the equipment using {178}GET ALL{078}.  You can then use the command {178}WEAR ALL{078} to wear
your newly won equipment.  If you already have the equipment lying in the room
use {178}SACRIFICE ALL{078} to get rid of it.

If you get wounded in combat you may need to {178}SLEEP{078} to regenerate hit points.
After you are back at full health you can use {178}WAKE{078} or {178}STAND{078} to get back up.

The Chamber of Testing~
This room, or chamber, is softly lit, and its centerpiece is a low, marble
pedestal.  A gentle twinge beneath your ribs affirms that your first true test
is at hand.  You are suddenly captured by the grey stone gaze of the statue
before you.

If you can kill the stone statue then you have passed the Tower's Test
of Completion.  As a reward you can pick up your token of completion from
the golem's corpse.  Make sure that you can at least handle the intermediate
hall of combat before you try to kill the statue.  The entrance hallway of
the tower is beneath you.  Beyond it lies the city of Roterodamum.

Recruitment Center~
You are standing in a large grey room.  Various banners on the wall praise the
virtues of either Gaia or Demise. Perhaps they are trying to sway you to their
side?  There are four offices here, one in each of the cardinal directions.  The
always-present stairway leads up and down.

By now you must have noticed that there are several gods controlling this world.
Here is your chance to go into each office and talk with their Recruiters. They
will tell you why you should become a follower of their god.  Don't worry, there
is no need to make any hasty decisions. You cannot actually make a commitment
here.

If one of the Recruiters says something in all capital letter, try saying that
word back to them. This will prompt the recruiter to tell you about that
statement. These 'keywords' as they are called will not always be capitalized,
but it has been done so in this area so that you can practice the concept. 
Beside one word, you may be required to answer with one whole sentence.

When you are finished talking with the Recruiters, continue practicing with your
mortal body by using the Intermediate Combat Hall downstairs.

attributes instead. To see a partial list of skills and spells you can
practice and how many practice sessions you have, type {178}PRACTICE{078}.  To
practice the specific skill, type {178}PRACTICE <SKILL>{078}, where SKILL is the skill
or spell you wish to practice. Practicing increases the amount you know of
that skill or spell, up to a certain maximum.

It is important to note that this practice room is only for use before you
