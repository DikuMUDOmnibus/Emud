                                 The Dungeon
{300}
The Dungeon is the ultimate method of harassment available to the Enforcers.

An imprisoned player will stay in the dungeon and cannot communicate with
the outside world until ones prison sentence expires.  The duration of this
cruel practice can be found in the finger info of the captive, the reason for
the display of power can be found by any enforcer using the file command.

0 STPD2 MULTIPLAY MULTIPLAYING~
{138}
                                Multi-Playing
{300}
Multi-Playing is legal, with a maximum of 5 characters at once.
~

{138}
                                Player Names
{300}
Suitable names are an essential part of maintaining a role-playing environment.

It has been deemed that for those who desire to name themself buttmunch, or
something of that order, no further punishment is required.
~

-1 STPD4 HARASSMENT~
{138}
                                 Harassment
{300}
Harassment is defined as one person going to extremes to make the game an
unenjoyable place for another player. Just so we know what we are talking
about.
~

0 STPD5 BUGABUSE~
{138}
                                  Bug Abuse
{300}
Bugs are defined as quirks in the coding that allow you to do things that
are not intended as a part of game play.  It's suggested to report them if
you find one, because they can imbalance the game, hence making it less fun.

Due to the programmer oftenly being very embarrased of having bugs in his/her
super code, you might get rewarded if you report the bug and keep it quiet.

0 STPD6 IDLING SCRIPTING~
{138}
                                   Idling
{300}
This is when your character is doing nothing, very relaxing.
{138}
                                  Scripting
{300}
This is rumored to prevent RSI. (repetitive strain injury)

Regardless of the seriousness of this disease, we require players to level
by normal play. Avoid automating commands that start a fight, and take you
from one room to another room, this includes flee, gohome, and n e s w u d.
~

0 STPD7~
{138}
              Appropriate Titles and other visible Information
{300}
Titles can be seen by everyone in the game, so if someone is pissed off at you
it might be your title.
~

0 STPD8~
{138}
                                 Punishment
{300}
Enforcers have a bunch of commands designed to harass players. We're not sure
why, they've always been there.
~

0 STPD9 SPAMMING~
{138}
                                  Spamming
{300}
Spamming is flooding another player with useless or irrelevant text. It is
typically done by repeating a command numerous times. Check out the 'block'
command if someone tries to communicate with you in this manner.
~

                               Player Killing
{300}
{128}- {138}Xanadu chats 'If you can't take the heat get out of the kitchen'{300}

Player killing, just like spamming is a means of displaying your frustrations,
unfortunately the block command doesn't work well against it. Currently you
must follow one of the Gods in order to join in in the fun.

Bubba is a large man, who has obviously not seen the inside of a wash-house
in many years. He's dressed in grubby, smelly coarse clothes that seem to
have been dragged through several fields of manure. As he sees you looking at
him, he leers at you, revealing 3 or 4 blackened teeth.

Center of the Dungeon~
You stand within the center of the dungeon of Storms of Time.  Glancing around
you can see the cook in the room above you.  To the east is the dungeon cell
where prisoners are locked up.  The eastern room leads to an interrogation
room, while down in the depths below lies the dragon training area.

The Dungeon Cell~
This is the infamous Dungeon Cell.  You must have committed a serious crime
to have been imprisoned here.  The room is quite filthy, for it serves as
the dungeon restroom.  A few other prisoners are shackled to the walls, and
you wish you had not commited your crime.

This is where all the dungeon masters buy themselves faithful dragons to take
into the field with them.  Plates full of fresh meat are being served to the
beasts which live here, as well as red hot coals of fire to fuel their firey

This room is filled with many blood-covered tools of torture are spread
around the room.  Razor sharp knives and hatchets, as well as whips and
flesh hooks are haphazzardly stacked in a small pile on a table.  You
