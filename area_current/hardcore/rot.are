the pedal.  In order to use it you should PLACE some cheese on it before

mouse trap~
a mouse trap~
A mouse trap stands here.~
It's a weird looking mouse trap.  Made from light colored wood and a metal
that has the color of copper.  The mechanism must have been thought up by
some kind of genius gnome.  It works with a little pedal that makes the
copper part of the device slam with a scary speed on something that presses
the pedal.  The trap has been activated and some cheese is placed on it.
Now all you have to do is place it on the ground where you expect a mouse
to snoop around.

containing various types of animal hide, and a large iron pot, filled with
boiling water, hangs in the crackling fireplace.  In the middle of the shop is a
large oak table. A wooden sign is hanging above the fireplace.

However when a shield against magic is erected the magical screams
are amplified by resonance with the shield. The screams emanate from
the souls of the dead, screaming for relief from the eternal torment and
suffering they must endure. To prompt their shouting, scream loudly.
Their wails will then be heard..."

tongue of our trade, the subject of this tome.  The letter A in the common

You are in a small, beautifully furnished room.  The warm light emanating from
the small oil lamps on the walls is reflected in the hard, polished surface of
