{300}
David Bills and Douglas Michael initially started Mortal Realms in 1993 with
the intent to create some nifty code. The MUD became quite popular having over
100 players online at peek times. Dug retired eventualy and several other
coders joined at various times. John Till helped from numerous areas to several
sections of code.  Martin Gallwey helped quite a bit with areas and coding.

The MrMud codebase was released in 1999 when David retired.

                                   Humans
{300}
Humans are the most simple race in the Realm. As such they make up the majority
of the population.  Although possessing no special abilities or bonuses, they
are the most adaptable and flexible race.  Their height, weight, eye and hair
color vary greatly.  They tend to live in large cities and to be harsh against
all things diffrent than themselves.

{300}
Halfelves are a cross between Elves and Humans.  They stand approximately 5
foot 7 inches tall and have hair colours ranging from snow white to dark black.
Their elven blood has weakened their strength and sturdiness, but enhanced
their quickness.  Though not as skilled with magic as the elves, they tend to
make better fighters.

                                  Griffons
{300}
Griffons are bird-like creatures from the highest mountain peaks of the realms.
Though they fly fast, they do not posses great strength, which does not stop
them from being excellent fighters.  They excel in the stronger magics, but are
not known to be gifted with healing or protective kinds.  Unlike other birds
they don't see very well in the dark.

                                  Vampires
{300}
Vampires are reincarnations of humans, cursed to live for eternity.  Though
undead, these creatures, also known as the hunters of the night feed off of
the vitae of living beings.  They are gifted with the ability of magical flight
and to see even in the darkest hours.  Along with the weaknesses of undeads,
they are more vulnerable during the day.

                                 Werewolves
{300}
Werewolves, just like vampires, are known as the hunters of the night.  A nose
to the wind and a wild throng of rage in their blood.  These creatures follow
the darkest paths of the beast, being able to turn their body into a furious
macabre of destruction, by embracing the wolf within.  Stronger and hardier
than normal mortals these supernatural beasts can change at will to serve
whatever purpose is needed.

{128}
                                   Gnomes
{300}
Gnomes are a quirky demi-human race.  Though not the mightiest of races, they
are well versed in their studies of knowledge and magics.  Due to their
familiarity with such lore, they tend to be more resistant to magics.  They can
however, suffer tremendously from physical attacks.  They most often prefer an
evening at home with a magical tome, a loaf of pipeweed bread, and a cup of ale
over venturing out into the realms.

{128}
                                    Elves
{300}
Elves are tall, slender creatures with an affinity for the woods and nature.
They are distant cousins to the Pixies and share the intelligence and
dexterity of that winged race to a lesser degree.  With a lighter frame than
humans, they make up their lack in strength and stamina with their superior
agility, both in thought and movement.  Elves prefer to stay close to nature
and away from dark magic and the violent ways of a warrior.

                                    Orcs
{300}
Orcs are large and dull of wit, with short but broad bodies.  Their poor
mental abilities is offset by an iron constitution, coupled with abnormal
strength.  They fear magic, and brute combat is the natural call which stirs
in the soul of an Orc.  They stand approximately five to seven feet tall and
see perfectly during the night.

{300}
Ogres stand from six to nine feet tall in height and are known for their
muscle-packed bodies that can weigh from three to four hundred pounds.
Most are relatively hairless, their bodies covered with small, boney growths.
Ogres inherit great physical attributes and healing powers from their distant
ancestry, wherein lies the hints of giant blood.

                                  Darkelves
{300}
Darkelves, better known as drow are the darker, more evil cousins of Elves.
They were once part of the community of Elves which roams the forest today,
but have long since moved under ground, building vast subterranean cities
and complex networks of caves.  They are lightning fast, and see with ease
in the darkest pits of the earth.  Their nature forces them to choose for
the dark magics or the glory of the battle fields.

                                   Dragons
{300}
Majestic, and respected as the wisest of all noble creatures, the name strikes
fear and awe into the hearts of all in its presence.  Dragons have grown
scarce over the ages.  They are armored both above and below, with strength
beyond that of mortal comprehension.  Dragons posess the ability to fly amongst
the clouds, which is the pride and purpose of all dragon life.

{128}
                                   Dwarves
{300}
Dwarves are a race of mountain and underground dwellers.  Naturally resistant
to magic, and having the strength and constitution of ages, these stalwart men
are fearsome warriors.  Dwarves can see in the dark and move at a fairly
normal rate of speed.  A dwarf can be described as rough, dark eyes and tanned
skin, the smell of forge and earth exude from their bodies.

when walking barefoot.

{128}
                                   Sprites
{300}
Sprites are woodland faeries, or more commonly known as nymphs.  Delighting
in joy and mischief, these winges beauties flutter about investing magic into
the realms.  They fly at exceptionally fast rates of speed and only see in
normal spectrums.  Not nearly as strong as a human, they are far wiser and far
more intelligent than most races.

{128}
                                   Shades
{300}
Shades are shadows of long passed and no longer enjoying the pleasures of the
flesh.  The shade moves at faster than rational speeds.  Able to see in the
night, and more dexterous than many races, the shades make lethal fighters.
The death of their body has granted them wisdom, but the fact that they must
coallese a body makes them slightly weaker.  These creatures retain the
ability of flight since they are not of the prime material realm.

                                    Rocs
{300}
Rocs are giant birds from the high mountains.  They commonly swoop to attack
an enemy from far up.  Because of their distance from society, they are not as
smart, or as wise as other races. Although,  given to flying at night, their
vision is enhanced.  Their size and strength make them formidable warriors,
but they make good wizards as well.

                                 Thri Kreen
{300}
Thri Kreens are giant mantis like creatures that run the deep deserts.  These
beasts fight in raging wars of glory and honor and move at astonishing rates
of speed and easily over terrains, making them exceptional foes.  They are
far more dexterious than most races and have a hard exoskeleton to protect
them from even the most brutal of attacks.

{128}
                                   Demons
{300}
Demons are cruel sadistic humans now turned to the darkness within.  They
have an uncany power to curse their foe.  Far stronger and more stalwart than
some races, the demons are fierce shadow warriors.  Because of their
transformation, they have lost some of the mental capabilities that graced
their previous forms, and yet the natural talent for magic embues them.

{128}
                                  Gargoyles
{300}
Either from the experiment of the Warlocks or an abomination, Gargoyles do
exist and they are close by at all times.  These stony creatures are grotesque.
Harboring permenantly disfugired forms, with huge veinous wings these
monsters are intimidating to say the least.  It has  yet to be explained how
the strength of these creatures came to be so great or how they move as fast
with their stone bodies.

{128}
                                   Wraiths
{300}
Tethered to this realm by some fetter, a wraith is a head mortal who has
unfinished business in the realms.  Since these beings are so incorporeal
they lose much dexterity and strength, but gain wisdom and intellect beyond
imagination.  Slow of movement, but strong of magical incarnation, these
spirits are supreme amongst the magic wielders.

                                   Trolls
{300}
Trolls are perhaps the strongest, yet obviously least intelligent race.
Sentient, yet posessed, the Troll's wounds begin to close as soon as it
is cleaved.  Standing seven or more feet tall, with weight above 300 pounds,
every Troll is a powerhouse of carnage.  Motley green flesh covering grizzled
features, allowing only a scowl.

                                   Titans
{300}
Titans stood up to the gods and are now merely a shadow of former power.
Towering the humans, titans are incredibly strong, wise, and hardy.  They
walk at slower speeds to insure they don't crush anyone.  Excellent at
combat and natural magics, titans become strong in both fields the more
they traverse the realms.

The phoenix is a firebird of immortal fortitude.  These creatures shall rise
from the ashes of their former self.  Graced with wings of brazen flame, the
phoenix is an angel in avian form.  Flashing through the skies as astonishing
rates of speed, these birds grow stronger with age.  A phoenix is gifted with
the ability to cast the most difficult of spells with ease.

{128}
                                  Warriors
{300}
A warrior is the outdoorsman and adventurous free spirit of the times.
A self-sufficent person, the warrior is adaptable and can survive in almost
any locale.  Skilled with weapons and able to utilize some of the finest
armor available, a warrior is physically skilled enough to take on most any
foe.  A warrior typically travels light, but he does have the mighty strength
to carry equipment needed in his travels.

Though not as skilled in battle at the higher levels as a Gladiator, the
Warrior might be the one with the most deadly skills around.

                                   Shamans
{300}
A Shaman is a healer who prefers to fight bare handed.  Though not as strong
when it comes to offensive magic as other spell casters, their punch will
overpower the strongest weapon with ease.
Though not the strongest magic wielder in combat, the Shaman will be the best
around when in need of healing or combat enhancing spells.
A Shaman in combination with a fighter is strongly suggested for players who
desire to multi-play.

                                  Marauders
{300}
The marauder is a dark character which makes use of many skills often deemed
improper by the rest of society.  They are known to haunt the darkest roads and
alleys.  The skills of the marauder reflect his way of life, be it sneaking,
peeking into others' inventories, picking locks, or attacking from behind
with deadly backstabs.  It all sprung forth from the dirty city streets.

Though not the strongest fighters Marauders are always useful when there is a
lock that needs pryed, or an item that one wishes to acquire without detection.

Marauders are strongly advised for players new to muds or Storms of Time.

{128}
                                   Druids
{300}
Druids are the magic wielders who excel in the protective and natural magics.
Though not as strong when it comes to offensive magic as other spell casters,
their protective auras make them a good companion for a group of adventurers
exploring the realms.

Alhough not the strongest magic wielder in combat, the Druid will be the best
choice when in need of protective spells.

A Druid in combination with a Shaman is strongly suggested for players who
desire to multi-play spell casters.

{128}
                                  Sorcerers
{300}
Sorcerers are the supreme offensive magic wielders who excel in brute magical
destruction.  Being weak in the beginning of their lives, they grow stronger
once they have mastered their acid blast and trickery cantrips which might
scare off most opponents once they hit them.

Though not the best companion when it comes to protective spells, one might
find the Sorcerer quite useful to weaken your foes.

A Sorcerer in combination with a Shaman and a fighter goes along well at the
higher levels for players who desire to multi-play.

{128}
                                  Warlocks
{300}
Warlocks are the most scholarly of the greater schools of magic, and have
spent millenia furthering the knowledge of their guild.  As a result, they
have at their control, some of the most powerful spells in the realms.

Warlocks can bend the fabric of the universe to suit their desires, allowing
them to transfer objects and people across vast distances, magically.

Warlocks also study the nature of death, and are capable of giving some form
of twisted life force back into the bodies of the slain, as well as tap the
life force of other living creatures.

Warlocks are very difficult for players new to muds or Storms of Time.

                                   Ninjas
{300}
Ninjas are the members of the darkest profession, and are generally shunned
by the more reputable members of society.  They learn the art of killing
while unseen, and have developed many skills to allow them to sneak around
unseen, and unheard.

Though not the strongest fighters, Ninjas are very likely to finish off where
someone else left off.

Ninjas can become fearfull opponents at higher level when multiclassed to
a warrior for enhanced damage to improve their knifing skill.

{128}
                                 Gladiators
{300}
Gladiators are those with a death wish who risk a certain death in the arena.
That which doesn't kill you will make you stronger, and some of them end up as
deadly fighting machines, known to be able to do hazardous damage in the blink
of an eye.

Some look down on their boring overdose of hack and slash.  Most fear the
cold steel destruction they represent.

Gladiators might be difficult for players new to muds due to the fact that
they gain most of their strength at higher level and from equipment.

0 LANGUAGE LANGUAGES~
{138}
                                  Languages
{300}
Characters initially receieve the language of the character's race and two
other random languages.  After a character reaches 3rd level a new language
is added.  This continues every 3 levels until all languages are known.

When a character tries to speak to another character, it will only work if the
speaker's current language (set by SPEAK) is one that is known by the listener.
If the listener does not understand, the speaker and the listener are notified
that they are not speaking the same language.  The LANGUAGE command lists all
the languages known by each character so that the correct language may be
found.

Monsters, and other beings in the game will only notify you that they are
speaking the wrong language if they try to talk to you or you use a TELL
to talk to them.

There are several commands, spells, and skills to get around the problem of
language barriers, but these are not initially given to the player.

                             Temporary help file
{300}
Due to the fact that we are still beta there is no help file yet on the
God of your choice.  Or should we be honest and admit that we tend to be
a little lazy?

Check out the help file on Demise, it pretty much counts for the other gods

bit random, but that's something you will have to find out for yourself.

0 INTERP INTERPRETER~
{138}
                                 Interpreter
{300}
The interpretor of Storms of Time includes many advanced features:

{168}1){300}  The ALIAS command can make redefined commands of multiple lines
{168}  {300}  and including arguments inside the alias.
{168}2){300}  The use of the '!' or '.' command repeats the previous command.
{168}3){300}  '.' followed by a letter repeats the last command started with that letter
{168}4){300}  The use of the '&' character will create one line of code that is
{168}  {300}  executed simultaneously.
{168}5){300}  All commands, and names of people, creatures, and objects may be referenced
{168}  {300}  by the first two letters that match with their actual name.
{168}6){300}  Scroll back buffer allows looking at previous screens.  see HELP BUFFER
{168}7){300}  On any given entry, you may enter up to 8 lines of text.
{168}8){300}  Commands that start with a number are repeats.

  example:
      t bal I have a question for you. & say How are you?
  executes as:
{138}      You tell Baldy 'I have a question for you.'
{038}      You say 'How are you?'{300}
  if you follow with:
      .
  executes as:
{038}      You say 'How are you?'
~

0 BUFFER~
{168}
Syntax: buffer [<pages>]
{300}
The buffer command utilizes 20k of ram for each player, recording all data
that goes to the screen.  The scroll back buffer allows the player to view
text that has scrolled off the page.

Use of the <pages> is optional.  Without it, the default is the previous
page.  When the user specifies a number, the page displayed will be the amount
of pages back that the player specified.  The actual amount of pages depends on
the amount of text on each page, with the minimum amount of pages stored being
16, up to a nominal maximum of 64 pages.

BUFFER 0 will redisplay the current page.

The size of each page is fixed by the size of the VT102 screen, regardless
whether the player is utilizing VT102.  If the player wishes to change the page
size and is not using VT102, then simply change the VT102 size.

The calculation of amount of lines does not consider lines over 80 characters,
so the PAGER may pause the screen.

~

0 SUICIDE~
{168}
Syntax: SUICIDE <password>
{300}
The suicide command will let you kill yourself.  This will not cost any
experience, but it does cause you to die.  This is useful if you are caught
in a room that is impossible to leave.  After committing suicide, the player
is suggested to visit the morgue to retrieve your items.

verb used in the damage message.  Here are all the damage verbs listed from
least damage to most damage:

0 DEATH~
{138}
                                    Death
{300}
When your character dies, you are reincarnated back to your death room.  Your
corpse is left behind in the room where you were killed, together with all
of your equipment.  Your gold stays with you.

Any spells which were affecting you are canceled by death.

You lose experience points for dying.  If you are first level, the amount you
lose is half-way back to the beginning of your level.  Higher levels take you
back to what you should have had to gain your last level, unless you have the
(KILLER) or (THIEF) flag.

Corpses decay after time, and the objects inside corpses fall to the ground.
Objects on the ground are quickly picked up by scavenging creatures.
Non-player corpses last about 5 hours of game time (5 minutes of real time).
Player corpses last *roughly* 45 hours of game time (15 minutes of real time).
Only the player who died can retrieve objects from their corpse.
{168}
Syntax: DEATH
{300}
The death command sets where you will die, or recall reset to.  This can
only be done at specific locations, depending on which god you follow, if any.
The room will say "{168}You feel safe here.{300}" when you may set your death room.

Simply type 'DEATH' in the appropriate room and it is set there.
~

0 KILLER THIEF~
{138}
                              Killers & Thieves
{300}
There are two flags that can show up in the WHO list that mark you as an
unsociable character.  These are (KILLER) and (THIEF).  You may only player
kill or steal if both you and the victim are followers of different gods.

A Killer is someone that used the Murder command to attack another player.  A
player killer (PK) is totally legal, as is player thief (PT), but there are
some serious restrictions on them.  When you are a player killer, the city
guards will all try to kill you on sight (although it is rumored that guards
aren't that quick or perceptive).  Also, when you die, with the PK or PT flag
you not only lose experience back to the start of your current level, but
also all the way back to the start of the previous level.  You will not become
a Killer if the person you try to murder is a Killer.  The flag is removed
on death or over a period of 24 real life hours of game time.

A THIEF is someone that tried to steal from another player and failed.  This
flag will last untill you die.

0 EXPERIENCE LEVEL XP EXP WORTH~
{138}
                             Experience & Levels
{300}
Your character advances in power by gaining experience.
The experience required to gain a level will vary from class to class.

{168}You gain experience by:{300}
    being part of a group that kills a monster
{168}You lose experience by:{300}
    fleeing from combat                 - based on level
    recalling out of combat             - based on level
    dying                               - back to max exp till next level

The experience you get from a kill depends on several things: how many players
are in your group; your level versus the level of the monster; how tough the
mob is; and some random variation.
{168}
Syntax: LEVEL
{300}
The LEVEL command will show your current experience in relation to other
levels of characters in your class.

~

0 TICK~
{138}
                                    Tick
{300}
Many of the game actions are based upon interval timers, including combat,
most autonomous monster actions, hp/mana/move regeneration, spell duration,
weather, and area resetting.

Of these timers, the hp/mana/move regeneration timer is popularly called the
'tick'.  Ticks on this mud average 60 seconds of real time, but the actual
amount varies randomly from 45 seconds to 75 seconds.

Area resettings are mainly based on the level of the mobs in it.  They will
vary from 3 to 25 game ticks.

Objects lying on the ground will vanish after 25 game ticks.

You can tell when an area is about to reset by the patter of little feet, or
other less obvious background noise.

0 GREP ?~
{168}
Syntax: grep <word>
Syntax: ? <word>
{300}
The GREP command, similar to the unix command, searches through the scroll
back buffer and locates lines that contains the <word>.  The system is case
sensative, and finds the last 10 cases.

The '?' command may be used in replace of the word 'GREP'.

This is very useful in showing things like the recent conversation you have
had with another player, and can be found by using the players name for the
word search, though you might find: 'grep replies' to work even better.

0 MOVEMENT~
{138}
                                  Movement
{300}
Movement on the EMud system is based on "Rooms".  Each room is a small area
that all the action takes place in.  Nearly all commands work only inside of
the room you are in.  To move around the realm, use the "north", "south",
"east", "west", "up" and "down" commands.  Movement has a specific delay that
may be changed by using the SPEED command.  Special types of movement involve
using skills or spells, such as RECALL, FLEE, or TELEPORT.  Each of these types
commands has a specific help page for them.

There are several commands that work outside your current room, such as TELL,
ETELL, SHOUT, GTELL, RCAST, and SHOOT.  These also have specific help pages and
may be a skill, spell, or an ability inherent in every character.
{168}
See also: NORTH, RCAST, SPEED, RECALL.
~

0 CAST~
{168}
Syntax: cast [<percentage>] [']<spell>['] [<target>]
{300}
Before you can cast a spell, you have to practice it.  The more you practice,
the higher chance you have of success when casting.  Casting spells costs mana.
The mana cost decreases as your level increases.

The <target> is optional.  Many spells which need targets will use an
appropriate default target, especially during combat.

If the spell name is more than one word, then you must quote the spell name.
Example: cast 'cure critic' frag.  Quoting is optional for single-word spells.
You can abbreviate the spell name.

When you cast an offensive spell, the victim usually gets a saving throw.
The effect of the spell is reduced or eliminated if the victim makes the
saving throw successfully.

Casting as a multi-class character casts at the level of the spells caster's
class. (Example:  10th level Ranger and 8th level Illusionist would cast
"Burning Hands" as a 8th level caster, not an 18th level caster)

A defensive spell is limited to affecting only those with a level over 60% of
the spell's level.  This means the previous example would limit defensive
spells to characters above 4th level.

Spell strength may be reduced by the addition of a percentage in front of the
spell name.  This effectively reduces the level of the spell cast.  Control of
spell strength is not an exact science, so only expect it's accuracy to be
within about twenty percent.
{168}

~

0 MOVE~
{168}
Syntax: move <skill>
{300}
MOVE, the command, will show you how much movement you will use on a skill
that you can do.
~

0 MANA~
{168}
Syntax: mana <spell>
{300}
Mana is the unit of power that a spell caster uses when spells are cast.  Mana
will decrease with casting, and go up over a period of time.  Some spells or
items may increase a spell caster's mana.  Mana goes up every level for a
spell caster based on wisdom and intelligence.  Mana usage on each spell
decreases based on the level, and the wisdom of the spell caster.

When a spell fails the mana usage is half of normal usage.  If the spell is
successful, but the target of an offensive spell 'saves' then the mana is not
divided by 2.

MANA, the command, will show you how much mana you will use on a spell that
you can cast.  This value will be different for most players, even on the same
spell.
{168}
See also: CAST, RANGECAST, MASS, STATS.
~

0 RANGECAST 'RANGE CAST'~
{168}
Syntax: rangecast <direction> <spell> <target>
{300}
Druids can cast their spells at a range of one room away.  It does cost
more mana to range cast than to simply cast.

If you want to cast 'chill touch' to the north at the fido you would type:
 > rangecast n 'chill touch' fido
{168}
See also: help on individual spells, CAST, MANA, MASS.
~

0 POLYMORPH~
{168}
Syntax: polymorph <race>

practice anything at this initial level.  Half of your previous practices
are transferred to your new class.

Storms of Time is a fantasy AD&D based game in a medieval realm where magic and
strength guide the play of the many people in the game.

                                 Using Help
{300}
The help system of Storms of Time is fairly detailed and complete.  It is
required that the player has a firm grasp of how the system works before they
play.

To initiate the help system just type "HELP" on the command line.  This will
bring up a menu of all the topics you can choose from.  Simply select the
letter associated with the option, and enter it alone on a line.

Some items are not found in the menu system.  You may locate these by looking
at the Summary listing that is in the menu.  Each individual topic may be
directly indexed by typing "HELP <topic>".  Ex:   "HELP DRINK"

The bottom few lines of most help screens will show a list of further topics
to find information on.  The topics are always related to the one currently
dispayed, and may help the character find a topic that is more specific than
the one that is currently displayed.  There may also be a menu listing.

The HELP system may include statements with a "[" "]" around them.  These
are optional items.  If the statement has a "<" ">" around them, then it is
an argument that must be added to the command.

                                Game Concepts
{300}
Storms of Time places the player in the role of a medieval character in a
world filled with magic, combat, and many challenges to overcome.  The world
also has one distinct advantage to other fantasy role-playing type games, in
that the other players can be directly dealt with as if they were part of the
realm.  The game takes no difference, as to whether a person in the game is
a real person, or a computer generated one, although the real ones are
generally much smarter than the computer generated counterparts.

Storms of Time is also a game based on real-time, and therefore there is no
way to pause the game, or load a previous position.  Death or victory is
permanent.

The game allows the player to choose from several classes when creating their
character.  The computer will randomly generate the stats for the character.
Although the player may not directly modify any of these stats during creation,
they may re-roll the stats and try for a better set.

{300}
Much of game play will take part in the central city of Roterodamum.  Since
this is the initial location of the player, after completing Mud School.

The City of Roterodamum contains several shops of magic, and also a scattering
of specialty shops that sell everything from arrows to water skins.  All these
shops can be easily used with several special commands that are dedicated to
shop use.  The player may even buy a pet for fun, or as a small assistance in
case they run into anything that wants to eat you.

The City of Roterodamum has many historical references placed throughout it's
interior, and the player may find it interesting to just explore around the
city.

Commands:  The commands that everyone in the game can do.
Skills:    These are commands that only a given class can do.
Socials:   These are commands that anyone can do, but have essentially no
           impact on the game.  They are for inter-player communication.

There are commands to list all the commands, skills, and socials.  These
should be consulted often, until the player has a firm grasp on the majority.

The player may also realize that only a very few are actually required to get
around in the game.  So do not think that not knowing all the commands will
not allow you to play.  Although the more commands that are known, the more
enhanced the player will be while interacting with the virtual game world.

The player may find that he does the same commands repeatedly.  The alias
system may solve many of these problems for the player.

There is also a scroll back buffer for those that do not have that capability
on their local terminals.

a stat known as MANA.  Classes that are physical based, and use skills, will
require only MOVEMENT.  Each skill or spell can be found using the HELP system.

Although the formats may appear strange at first, the player will readily get
used to them, and not require the use of the HELP system, exept as a reference.

			    The Character:

The character has several primary components:

   1)  Personalization.        (Character name and title)
   2)  Background of study.    (Character class and race)
   3)  Statistics.             (Character attributes)
   4)  Languages.              (Character knowledge of languages)
   5)  Equipment.              (Equipment found within the game)

Each of these components should be understood and decided upon before character
generation should continue.

                               Personalization
{300}
The format of Storms of Time is a fantasy world, so the player may wish to
select a fantasy name.  Although the name must not be the same as another
character, or that of a creature in the game.

To have gotten this far into the instructions, then it is obvious that you
have successfully entered a password.  You may later change your password if
desired.

Characters have two other places where they may enter in a personalized
heading.  They have a title, which shows up in several places immediately after
the character's name.  They also have a description, which can be several
lines, and is displayed when another character looks at them.

Players may wish to use some of the built in commands, such as ALIAS to
modify stock commands to do more personalized things.

                         Background of the Character
{300}
Each player must select one of the eight given classes.  These classes define
what the character will have for a "job" in the fantasy world.  To complement
this, the character will need to choose a race.  The race may actually be
selected during character creation.

The class of a character will define which of the stats should be highest
when deciding on when to keep a character.  The exact nature of what these
stats mean will be understood later in the game, and have little relevancy
here.

Nearly all very low level characters perform about the same regardless of
their class or statistics.  As a character advances, the statistics become
more important.

The race of a character defines who his parents were.  A character may be a
sprite, human, gnome, dwarf, ogre, or other races.  Each of these slightly
modify some of the stats of the character, so in most cases, the final
selection of a good character for a particular class, will end up with a good
choice of race.  Race will effect some commands directly and each race will
have a unique ability or command that will usually increase in strength with
level.

                                 Statistics
{300}
Each character has 5 primary attributes, and several other statistics that
change throughout the game.  Each character may want to increase some of these
stats later, and Mud School gives the opportunity to modify some of the stats
immediately.  This lets the player personalize even the stats of the character.

HIT POINTS  (Hp) is an arbitrary number that defines how much damage a
                 character can take, before they die.
MOVEMENT    (Mv) is a number defining the amount of endurance a character has.
MANA        (Mn) is a number defining the magic power a character has.
LEVEL      (Lev) ranks each character against other characters in the game.
EXPERIENCE (Exp) defines how far a player has advanced between each level.
GOLD       (Gld) defines how much money a character has in gold pieces.

You will find things to be sometimes unrealistic, the reason is mosty to
enhance the playability of the game.

STRENGTH     (Str) describes how strong a character is, and affects how hard
                   an opponent is hit.
DEXTERITY    (Dex) is assigned for the quickness of a character and affects
                   how hard the character is to hit by an opponent.
CONSTITUTION (Con) is a factor of the endurance of the character and affects
                   how quick the character recovers, after being hurt.
INTELLIGENCE (Int) describes how much "book knowledge" a character has, and
                   affects a spell's chance to succeed.
WISDOM       (Wis) is a generic stat that describes how well a character
                   advances with each level.

Each of these previous statistics can be temporarily changed by magic.  They
may also be changed permanently by training at one of the several training

{300}
Storms of Time contains a system that each of the races has their own distinct
language.  Each character starts out with three of these that includes the race
of the character.  The character, when talking to another character, will have
to choose a language to speak in.

Then the receiving party must be able to understand the language that you are
speaking in.  If this is successful, then anything you type in to "say" will
be displayed for them exactly.  It is not necessarily true that both
characters must be speaking in the same language.

As a player advances in level, they will learn more languages.  There are
also a few spells that will enhance the player's ability to communicate.

Nearly all commands that deal with communication use some form of the language
system.  The major exception to this is a system for emergency communications.

In an emergency, the player may sacrifice some experience for talking to
anyone, using: etell

                             Items and Equipment
{300}
The player will notice items on the ground that he wishes to use.  He may also
pick things up immediately from a kill, or buy items in a shop.  Regardless,
the character must transfer the item from his inventory to his equipment.

When a player wears an item, it turns into equipment.  When it is in the
inventory, then it is just carried on the person.  The character must also have
the item in the inventory, not equipment, to drop the item.  There is a special
feature called sacrifice that purges an item from the room.  In this case, the
item must be on the floor.

A player may drop an item, but must be aware that another character may come
along and take it.

Each character has a limit on the amount of weight and items that they may
carry.  These amounts are based on your strength and dexterity.

0 PORT~
{168}
Syntax: port  [<block size>]
{300}
The port command was developed to utilize a small feature of the Internet
that allows small packets to transfer quickly, and large packets to transfer
after a significant lag.  The port command breaks the text sent to the player
into blocks that are user defineable (default 2000).

To minimize lag, reduce this number until lag eases up, but increase it if
response time is too slow.  This system has an optimum value, and lower values
work best for longer distance from the server.  Higher values for close
distances to the server.  There is no 'general' or optimal setting.  The user
will have to try several values within the range.

This system is known to cause VT102 and ANSI systems to lose track of
cursor placement.  To solve this, use the maximum block size.

The range of block size is:    1000   to  10000

                                   Corpse
{300}
When a player dies a corpse is created at the spot where he died.  Then the
player awakens naked at their predefined death room shown in score.  They
will have basically no items at all, and must work out a method of recovering
the lost items.

The first place he should check is at the Morgue in the city, where he can
buy back his corpse.  It will show up in the room, where he can retrieve his
items.

When a player gets the items from his corpse, the corpse will instantly decay.
The player that died is the ONLY person in the game that may take items out of
his own corpse.

The game will save your corpse along with the character data, so that if the
game crashes before the player has a chance to get the corpse, it will not
just disappear.  Also the player may quit the game when he dies, because the
corpse will enter the game the same time the player does, even several days
later.  The corpse will ONLY start decaying if the player is on the game.

someone.

Normal hard coded attack rules are non existant in the arena.

You will NOT lose any experience while in the arena.

When you die, you will revive at Roterodamum Square.

Players may not RECALL or GOHOME in the Arena.

The player may locate the Arena Sprite for magical assistance, but he will not
help if he finds you.

The player may also be attacked by the Arena Beast, which is always slightly
stronger than the individual that he is attacking.

There are several ways to reference numbers and objects in Storms of Time.
The examples that follow use the 'get' command as a reference.

1) Simple:           GET <object name>
   ex:   get arrow          - Gets first arrow.

2) Directed:         GET <item number of object refered to>.<object name>
   ex:   get 2.arrow        - Gets second arrow.

3) All:              GET ALL
   ex:   get all            - Gets everything.

4) All Directed:     GET ALL.<object name>
   ex:   get all.arrow      - Gets all of the arrows, leaving other objects.

5) Counted:          GET <amount> <object name>
   ex:   get 5 arrow        - Gets five of the arrows on the floor.

This system works for most object, mobile related commands.

Syntax: REPEAT <amount> <command string>
Syntax: <amount> <command string>

The REPEAT command will simply type in the input string for you the amount of
times specified by the amount variable.
This command is limited by the space in the input buffer, which is slightly
over 1200 characters.  Also the command is limited by 2 to 40 repeats.

The REPEAT command need not be typed out, since all command lines that start
with numbers are by default considered a repeat command.

example:  repeat 10 buy recall
  or
example:  10 buy recall
  Both of these would buy 10 recall scrolls, one at a time.

{300}
Storms of Time is made up of 9 continents surrounded by oceans. Each continent
contains many separate areas that are linked together by the Roads. Seven of the
continents (aside from the Magic Zone and Iosolo) contain at least one area that
is serviced by Griffon Airlines, allowing for fast and convenient (though
costly) travel between continents.

Additionally, the Roads themselves have direct connections to other areas and it
is possible to walk to many areas. Some are connected directly to others
(requiring you to pass through one to get to the other). In that case, only the
area connected directly to the Roads is shown on the map.

For instance, by typing HELP ROADS, and then typing T for the Toril Continent,
you can view the other areas within that continent.  By looking at the map, you
can see that to get to Tethyr from Waterdeep you would travel south-east and
then west.  Signs posted along the way can be of valuable assistance as well.

                                 Armor Usage
{300}
The following lists the modifiers for armor, or lack thereof, for each Class:
The values are the percent of body covered.  Higher values take into account
that a class has a better ability to use that particular type of armor.

{178}             {178}    Body    Head    Legs    Feet    Arms    Hands  Shield

{178}Sorcerer     {078}     30      15      20      10       5      10     none

{300}
An item with 10% coverage is the same value as the AC of the armor.  Larger
coverage values are multiples of the basic AC of the object, such as an item
worn on the body gives three times the AC that an identify will display.

{300}
The VT102 command can be turned on and off by the commands:

VT102 ON
VT102 OFF

Simply typing VT102 will give the status of the vt102 system.

The VT102 system modifies all output to your terminal by including information
using vt102 codes.  Vt102 is nearly compatible with vt100, but several commands
might not be implemented in the vt100 system that the VT102 system requires. It
is suggested that all systems run with VT102 on, although it is not necessary.
~

0 VT02~
{138}
                                VT102 Sizing
{300}
The VT102 system allows for terminal sizes of 80 columns only.
The rows, however, may be set with any value in the range of
15 rows to 80 rows.

The VT102 command with a number for an option sets the rows
to that amount.  A refresh of the display is done during this
operation.
~

0 VT03~
{138}
                              VT102 Bold/Nobold
{300}
The VT102 system scans all outgoing data for the word 'You' in any case, and
regardless if it is nested inside another word like 'yourself'.  This intensity
change can be overridden by comands that have defined brightness levels.

This feature is normally on by default, although the user may select to turn
it on or off at any time by issuing the commands:

VT102 BOLD
VT102 NOBOLD

The basic reasoning behind this option is that nearly all lines of text that
the game displays that relate directly to the player contains some form of
the word 'You'.  This means that lines directly relating to the player are
bold, while those that are related to others are dim.
~

0 VT04~
{138}
                               VT102 Slow/Fast
{300}
The VT102 system has the ability to be backward compatible with VT100 systems.
Normally this is not desirable, because the VT100 system operates with less
optimization.  Although it may be required on various operating systems, from
Mac to AIX.  It is suggested that the user try VT102 in fast mode first, and
if any weird display problems crop up, try VT102 in slow mode.

The commands to change the compatibility modes are:

VT102 FAST
VT102 SLOW

{300}
This symptom occurs when the terminal rows are set too low.
Try adjusting the terminal size with 'VT102 <rows>' until only one blank input
line shows up at the bottom of the screen.

The default size is 24 rows, but PCs occasionally use 25, and workstations,
or Windows terminals may use longer screens.

             Occasionally random characters pop up on the screen
{300}
This symptom occurs if your terminal cannot emulate VT102 correctly.  This
occasionally occurs on Macs, VMS, and AIX systems.  To correct this problem
use the 'VT102 SLOW' option.
~

0 VTP04~
This system occurs when the HOOK command has been engaged in some
form.  Try turning off all the options on the HOOK command.
This is done by issuing the 'HOOK' command and determining which
options are currently ON.  Turn them off by the 'HOOK' command
followed by the capitalized letter in the HOOK status list.

{138}
              How can I change the text from Reverse to Normal
{300}
The method for changing the default characteristics of REVERSE/NORMAL text is
rather convoluted.  It is based of of the COLOR command, and is only allowable
on system that do NOT use color.

Use the 'COLOR ON' command, and change any of the types of text you wish to
make REVERSE by changing the background color to some value besides 0, and
change the forground to 0.

Finially issue the 'COLOR OFF' command to return to normal video mode.

This will allow you to select whether you wish the status bars to be
in reverse video or normal text.

The Rawdata system allows interfaces to intercept special characters and
interpret them to get binary information on characters as the information
changes.  This system is designed for easing external interface designs and
allowing graphical interfaces, or systems of semi-automation, where character
stats are required to be understood.

It is suggested that the VT102 system be disabled when using a custom
interface.  To temporarily disable the VT102 interface, use the REQUEST command.

This system is currently under construction, but the specifications are
formalized.

REQUEST V-     Temporarily turns off VT102 mode.
REQUEST V+     Turns VT102 back on after being temporarily disabled.

REQUEST C+     Turns ansi color back on after being temporarily disabled.

This could be useful for character sharing.

                   Details on the Raw Data specifications
{300}
The code sends information to the client program in the following format:
<Initialize byte>  - a single byte of non-ascii value selects format of info.
<Index value>      - a single byte that selects which data field the info is of.
<Information>      - Various formats depending on format.
<29>               - Byte is only used on text strings to signal end.

The following is a list of the various format types and initialize byte:
Init  Type            Information
22 -  long int       - 4 bytes binary.
23 -  Packet Record  - string in ascii.
24 -  Packet Display - string in ascii.
25 -  single byte    - 1 byte binary.
26 -  int            - 2 byte binary.

0 PACKET00~
{138}
                      Information on the Packet system
{300}
The packet system allows much faster transfer of particular sets of text that
repeats often.  This system can also be used to recognize actions by the
client program, and use them for such things as graphic motion, or sound.

Packet Record Mode <23> sends the index and the full string, followed by a
ending byte <29>.
Packet Display Mode <24> sends only the index of the string to the client
program.

Each time a session is started, the packet list is flushed for each character.
A particular packet is sent in it's full text version only once per session.
Any subsequent sends are in the Packet Display mode.

The client program must be able to store the information from a Packet Record,
for later use by the Packet Display code.

0 AUTO~
{168}
Syntax: AUTO [off/quick/auto]
Syntax: AUTO [<skill/spell name>]
{300}
The AUTO command automates combat in several ways.  AUTO will execute a
command continually until you run out of mana or movement for a particular
skill.  AUTO can always be interupted by typing in a new command.  The WIMPY
command will always override an automatic command.  AUTO will always start
when a player starts combat.

AUTO OFF   - turns off the automatic system.
AUTO AUTO  - turns on the basic automatic system.
AUTO QUICK - turns on the advanced automatic system.

The QUICK mode modifies normal combat, by allowing double speed skills or
spells, at the cost of losing normal attacks.  This is a very good system for
spell casters.

                                   Socials
{300}
A social is a command that is used to convey an action that is used for
communication, such as 'laugh'.  These commands can be used to convey extra
depth to a statement, and are intended to give a visual clue to the body
language a character would normally use under person-to-person conversation.
Socials can range from funny to vulgar, and can change meaning depending on
the circumstance of the conversation.  Socials follow no set pattern, but
have no real impact on the game.  Socials only work in the same room.

There are three modes of socials:     (examples will use the laugh command)
<social command>                              - Player will simply laugh
<social command> {your name here}             - Player will laugh at himself
<social command> {another person's name here} - Player will laugh at another

To get a complete list of all the socials at any time use the 'SOCIAL' command.

Experiment with another player on what all the socials do, they can get rather
funny. =]

Syntax:  SPAM [< option letter >]
{300}
Spam is a command that turns off certain aspects of combat messages.
It allows those with slow links to have a more timely combat, or just to
filter out undesired combat messages.

SPAM by itself shows a list of the current settings.  It is suggested that the
player try a few of these settings before deciding on any one setup.
The default setting is everything on except the status list.

The status list shows an extra line after each combat round as to the condition
of each of the players in the current player's party.  The data shown is current
and maximum hitpoints.  This may be used by itself as an extra piece of data
with everything else on, or a summary when some of the other statements are
turned off.

Spam used in conjunction with CONFIG can shortened overly long combat rounds
significantly.
~

0 INN~
{138}
                                    Inns
{300}
Inns are special places in the realm, where sleeping is healthy for you.
If you quit in an Inn, you will gain hit points, movement, and mana back
while you are not on the game.  The rate is one point per level of the
character, per hour not on the game.
The room will say "You feel safe to sleep here" when you are in an Inn.
~

0 GUARD~
{168}
Syntax: none
{300}
The GUARD skill gives you a heightened awareness of the items you have in
your possession, such that you can tell if anyone attemps to steal them.  A
well developed GUARD skill will prevent the majority of all attempted thefts
from your person.  Once this skill is learned, it is always in effect.
~

0 PLANT~
{168}
Syntax: plant <item> <player>
{300}
If you wish to give an item to a player without them realizing you have done
it, then, PLANT is the skill for you!  PLANT allows you to get rid of that
HOT item before the Enforcers get to you.
{168}
See also: STEAL
~

0 CAMP~
{168}
Syntax: camp
{300}
After a long, hard few minutes of taking out large and aggressive monsters,
your party needs to make a CAMP.  When you make a CAMP, you REST or SLEEP
much better.  This enables you to regain your strength (HP,MANA,MOVEMENT)
faster than mere resting on the path will.  Also, while you are camped,
all of the people who are in your group, in your current room, and are either
RESTing or SLEEPing will get the same benefits!

To break CAMP, simply STAND, or have one of your GROUP get attacked...
~

0 'ENERGY SHIFT'~
{168}
Syntax: cast 'energy shift' <target> [<value>]
{300}
This spell transfers magical energy in it's truest form to the target.
The ratio of transfered energy is 1 mana for the target for each 2 expended
by the warlock.  This value is then compared to the level difference of the
characters.  A warlock of 80th level would give 1/10 normal mana to an 8th
level player.  The value is the amount of mana you are willing to transfer.
~

0 ILLUSION~
{168}
Syntax: cast illusion
    or: cast illusion <target>
    or: cast illusion <short description>
{300}
This spell creates a pet of your choice.  Well...at least a pet that looks
like some creature or player or whatever.  The first form of the illusion
spell where you just type "cast illusion" will create a duplicate of yourself
for you to command around.  If you don't want a simulacrum of yourself, you
can make one of ANYONE or ANY CREATURE.  Simply be in a room with the creature
you want to make an illusion of.  For example:
  If you are in a room with "A Beastly Fido", typing:
  >cast illusion fido
  Would create an illusion of the fido that looked exactly like the Fido.
The last form of the illusion spell lets you create your own creature.  Unfor-
tunately, you will only be able to specify a short description of the creature.
Like:
  cast illusion "A Dark and Menacing Beast"
or
  cast illusion "Frank the Illusionist"

NOTE: All illusions will be 3/4 of your current level in the Illusionist guild.
~

0 'WINGED CALL'~
{168}
Syntax: cast 'winged call'
{300}
This spell will summon a fairly weak but mountable flying creature.
~

0 BERSERK~
{168}
Syntax: berserk
{300}
This skill allows you to put away all thoughts except raw battle.  When you are
BERSERK, you will hit harder and more often.  You will also be able to channel
your adrenaline in such a way as to give you more stamina.  A side effect of
going BERSERK is that you will not be able to control yourself beyond deciding
where to go and who to KILL or MURDER.

NOTE: Only PURE warriors have the proper frame of mind to go BERSERK.
~

0 BLOODFRENZY 'BLOOD FRENZY'~
{168}
Syntax: bloodfrenzy
{300}
This skill literally makes your blood boil with rage.  You'll inflict more
damage and posses a greater strength.
~

0 INDUCTION~
{168}
Syntax: cast 'induction' [<value>]
{300}
This spell drains your physical strength to add to your magical strength.
You enter the amount of hit-points you wish to drain and you will gain
one-half that amount of mana.
~

0 RESTORE~
{168}
Syntax: cast 'restore' <target> [<value>]
{300}
This spell uses large quantities of mana to heal large quantities of
hit-points on the target.  The ratio is one-half the hit-points for the mana.
You select how much mana you are willing to spend.
~

0 FORGE~
{168}
Syntax: forge <object name> <new short description>
{300}
This skill lets you take an object and alter it to make it look like something
it isn't.  A lot of the effect is based upon your sheer strength of suggestion,
so the object will eventually revert to its original appearance.  If, for
example, you wanted to make a dagger look like a broadsword you would type:

> forge dagger A long, dark broadsword

Then, you could do with the "broadsword" whatever you could normally do with
the dagger, and everyone would see that you were doing it with a "broadsword."

A failed forge attempt might possibly result in the destruction of the object.
~

0 'DETECT FORGERY'~
{168}
Syntax: none
{300}
Once this skill is learned, it automatically lets you determine if an object
is a forgery.
~

0 'CRITICAL HIT'~
{168}
Syntax: none
{300}
Once this skill is learned, you will be able to render wounds upon your enemy
that will drain him/her of his/her life's blood, slowly, but methodically.  The
wounds will heal over time and with certain "healing" spells.  This skill is an
enhancement of your KNIFE skill.

Even the best users of this skill will not be able to do it continually, but as
the opportunities arise when using his/her KNIFE skill.

It is possible for victims of critical hit to bleed to death after the
ninja has been vanquished or the victim has somehow escaped the battle.
~

0 'MIRROR IMAGE'~
{168}
Syntax: cast 'mirror image' [<name>]
{300}
This spell creates several images of the target player (default target is the
caster).  The images make it harder for the player to be hit during combat.
What happens, is that someone (or something) that attacks the player, will
often actually attack one of the player's images instead.  This destroy's the
image, but does NOT hurt the player.  Only a few magical attacks are fooled
by mirror images, so most offensive spells will automatically attack the actual
player.
~

0 'HALLUCINATE'~
{168}
Syntax: cast 'hallucinate' [<name>]
{300}
This COMBAT spell causes the named player to start seeing things.  The player
will no longer be able to tell who's doing something to anything.  They will
be able to see the events happen, but not exactly what the event is that is
happening.  For example, instead of the following line being seen by the
player:
         "Newguy gets a large bow."
The player might see:
         "Hypnos gets a house plant."
~

0 TACTICAL~
{138}
                                  Tactical
{300}
The tactical command allows you to bring up a drop down list of mobiles
that are in the room, with a number specifying the hit/hit_max ratio in
10% increments, with 'F' being Full.  The bold names are those in your group.
There are numbers between the status and name further discussed in Combat Mode.

The tactical display also includes the top stat bar to optimize it's
performance.  This means we have added a few more features to it.
The first is a game clock, which relates time in the realm.
The second is a single letter for your current speed.

A larger display should not change transmission rate, so use the largest you
can stand.

The TACTICAL command allows you to change the size of the tactical map, with
the value '1' turning off the Tactical display.  The maximum size of the
tactical depends on your terminal display size.  The absolute maximum is 19.

0 TACT03~
{138}
                                 Combat Mode
{300}
Each character and creature has a distinct index assigned to them.  For players
this means that your assigned number will never change.  For creatures, it
means that it will change for each new creature created when areas reset.
These numbers can be used to distinguish individual creatures of the same kind.

The numbers only show the last two digits, so repeating is possible, but fairly
slim chances.  These numbers normally appear between the health status and the
name of the character.

When in combat, a fighting character will display the '>' symbol followed by
another index number.  This means that thar particular character is fighting
the pointed to character.

The tactical numbers may be toggled on and off using the 'TACTICAL N' command.

The TACTICAL INDEX command allows you to change your designator from the
default number.
~

0 TACT04~
{168}
Syntax:  TACTICAL INDEX <two letter index>
{300}
The tactical index allows the player to choose 2 letters, numbers, or symbols
to replace the default value given by the tactical system.
~

0 COMPASS~
{138}
                                   Compass
{300}
The Compass that is integrated into the Tactical map has several options.
The Compass has two sizes depending on how large your Tactical map is.

To change the width of the compass, type:
TACTICAL COMPASS <Direction Name Width>
This will change the length in characters of the words in the Compass.
The possible values for widths are:
0           :   Turns off Compass.
4 through 16:   Turns on Compass with specified widths on words.

The names of rooms have special colors that show what terrain type the room is.
To get a complete list of these types, simply type 'TACTICAL COMPASS' without
a number.

The Compass may slow down your system a bit, but it's great for exploring.

When using the compass, it is suggested to turn the AUTO_EXIT in the CONFIG
command off.

~

0 TACT02~
{138}
                              Future additions
{300}
Over-view of the room showing player and mobile arrangements during
combat.  This will allow a 'chess-like' feature to the game.

~

0 TACT05~
{168}
Syntax:  TACTICAL TOP
Syntax:  TACITCAL BOTTOM
{300}
This command modifies the look to the tactical display.  It moves the top
status bar either to the very top of the screen, or the bottom line of the
tactical display.  This command only affects the upper portion of the display.
It may be of value to shift the tactical to the bottom for clarity.
~

0 DISPLAY~
{168}
Syntax: DISPLAY <object or mobile name>
{300}
This command works similar to looking at an object, but sends a picture
of the object instead.  This system is set up for objects and mobiles that
have defined displayable pictures.

Looking at an object normally will say if the object has a displayable
picture.

This mode requires that the system be a IBM-PC system with a color terminal.
Any other system that has the ascii character 220 ( a half solid block ) will
also work.

The displayed image is 78 by 40 pixels with 8 colors.
This is the first bitmap graphics format for Emud, and is fairly basic.
There are also very few objects or mobiles that incorporate this feature.

This command incorporates special features when working with MrTerm.  Notably
a much higher transfer rate.

0 MAP~
{168}
Syntax: MAP [<range>]
{300}
The map command works with the range system to give you a view or the
surrounding rooms.  It shows all open exits at each room.  The colors
represent the sector type, the same as the tactical compass.  Without a
specificed range, the map is shown at it's maximum size, but the text size is
reduced.  The range value can limit it to a shorter, but clearer, view.
{168}
See also: ROADS, ARENA, OBELISK.
~

0 REINCARNATE~
{168}
Syntax: REINCARNATE <class> <race> <sex> <password>
{300}
The reincarnate system is designed to give players near-unlimited play length.
Essentially, it allows a maxed level player (95th) to start the character over
again.  With each successive generation of reincarnations, the game setting
gets increasingly harder, but gives out larger gains.

When reincarnating stats are rerolled, similar to the character generation
system, when someone first starts playing.  The reincarnate command may be
executed successively, until the desired stats are found.

The reincarnate command may not be issued after the character gains even one
experience point, when rerolling stats, although a 95th level character may
select to reincarnate at any time.

The reincarnated character will lose all gold, items, and skills/spells.
But they will retain their castle.  The hours played will be maintained,
but the age will reflect the correct value for the new character.  The
amount of reincarnations a character has been through can be seen in the
FINGER command.

There are only three places where reincarnation numerically affects the new
character, bonuses when gaining a level, amount of experience earned for a
kill and the maximum statistics.  With each successive reincarnation, bonuses
per level will increase with: 8 hp, 6 mana, 5 move and 3 practises.  With each
successive reincarnation the amount of experience gained for a kill is lowered
by 1/3rd and 1 point is added to each statistic.
~

0 PROMPT~
{168}
Syntax: prompt [<arguments>]
{300}
The PROMPT command is used to reconfigure the prompt display for players that
do not use the tactical information, or cannot use the VT102 support.
The player would simply give an argument of various terms.  These terms would
be directly displayed on the prompt.  The player may also determine what kinds
of information they are to receive.  To add a variable, the user would place
a '$' symbol followed by a key character that represents what the variable is.

  Key fields:  '$h'  Current Hit Points      '$H'  Maximum Hit Points
               '$v'  Current Movement        '$V'  Maximum Movement
               '$m'  Current Mana            '$M'  Maximum Mana
               '$x'  Total Experience        '$X'  Experience till Next Level
               '$l'  Current Life Percentage '$L'  Opponent's Life Percentage
               '$g'  Gold                    '$a'  Alignment
               '$s'  Speed                   '$S'  Language
               '$f'  Affects                 '$e'  Exits
               '$t'  Mud Time                '$T'  Clock
               '$w'  Wait State (lag)        '$c'  Color Gradient next $
               '$$'  Returns a '$' symbol    '$/'  Carriage Return (newline)

Example:    prompt <$h/$Hhp $m/$Mm $v/$Vmv $Xxp ($L)>

The prompted defined would be:  <35/46hp 100/100m 66/110mv 2280xp (--)>

To use a default prompt use: 'prompt 1', 'prompt 2', 'prompt 3', or 'prompt 4'.
~

0 DUMP~
{168}
Syntax: dump
Syntax: dump buffer
{300}
The dump command is a method of saying things in a batch.  It is designed to
display something stored in a clipboard, or other transfer system.  Simply
issue the DUMP command and any following lines are 'said' without having to
specify a command in front of the individual 'says'.  The character will
continue to 'dump' statements into the room until the STOP command is issued.

If you have something of importance in your BUFFER an immortal should know
about you have the ability to dump your buffer. This way an immortal can
look at the buffer, this comes in helpful if some weird game error occurs
that is otherwise hard to explain.

If you dump your buffer twice, the first buffer dump will be over written.
~

0 MOST~
{168}
Syntax: MOST [category]
{300}
The most command lists who has the "most" of a particular statistic.  It's
quite possible that the names listed will change as the game progresses.
If you enter a category you will see the top 50 players for that particular
category.
~

0 TRAVEL~
{168}
Syntax:  TRAVEL [<direction>]
{300}
The travel command is to assist the player in traveling long distances.  It
simplifies journeys by following a path until it reaches an intersection for a
spot that the character can no longer travel further on.  Travel can also be
used as a general movement command, but the player may past places of interest.
Travel is the fastest way to travel lag free, and many may notice that it gets
them past evil creatures better then wandering around.

The travel direction may be reversed in mid-course, and stopped by issuing
the travel command without a direction.
~

0 'MAGE BLAST'~
{168}
Syntax: cast 'mage blast' <target>
{300}
Mage blast is a very powerful spell.  It reduces the magical defensive
strength of creatures and characters.  This spell is so powerful that it may
only be cast once on any creature during a fixed amount of time.  If the spell
is successful, then the victim is more open to magical attack.  If the spell is
a failure, then the aura of the mage blast will remain around the target, but
it will not effectively cause any damage.  This spell is relatively fast in
casting time, but costs a significant amount of mana.
~

0 FISTICUFFS~
{168}
Syntax: none
{300}
Fisticuffs is a form of advanced attack for Shamans.  Once learned shamans
will do better at fist fighting than any other class.  In order to do so
one has to remove their weapon.  The power and frequency of fist attacks
will improve with every level.
~

0 MARTIALARTS 'MARTIAL ARTS'~
{168}
Syntax: none
{300}
Martial arts is a form of advanced attack for Ninjas.  This is not a single
type of attack, but an entire group.  During the course of advancing through
the various levels, the Ninja will aquire the ability to use new forms of
martial arts attacks.  IN order to use martial arts one has to remove their
weapon.  The power and frequency of martial arts attacks will improve with
every level.
~

0 ACUPUNCH~
{168}
Syntax: acupunch <victim>
{300}
Acupunch is a very dexterious skill allowing a ninja to hit their victims
at critical spots, causing their foe to temporarily lose control over their
body, or even lose conscious.
~

0 CLIMB~
{168}
Syntax: none
{300}
Climb skill is the ability to climb rocky terrain that a character may fall
from.  Falling from terrain may be deadly.  Climbing skill is a significant
benefit to traversing this type of terrain, as it is usually windy so that any
flying spell serves no value.  Normal characters must rely on their dexterity
to get them up or down a cliff, while users may have the added benefit of
the practice and training of the climb skill.
~

0 WITHDRAW~
{168}
Syntax: flee <direction>
{300}
The withdraw skill allows one to flee using an optional direction. This
highly increases your chance of escape from combat if used properly.
~

0 ENDURANCE~
{168}
Syntax: none
{300}
The endurance skill allows one to travel through wilderness and rough terrain
with minimal movement loss.
~

0 BREATHWATER 'BREATH WATER'~
{168}
Syntax: cast 'breath water' <target>
{300}
This spell lets the target breath water as if it was air.  This is a
manditory spell for the traversal of underwater areas, as most people can't
normally breath water.  This spell, similar to astral travel, can be cast
upon the target repeatedly, with each cast replenishing the 'air supply'.
Although the effects are not cumulative, they don't let the character choke
on water at any time.
~

0 FIREWALK~
{168}
Syntax: cast 'firewalk' <target>
{300}
This spell lets the target walk through lava as if it was grass.  This is a
manditory spell for the traversal of lava areas, as most people would be
turned into a pile of ash in a matter of seconds.
~

0 'ETHEREAL TRAVEL'~
{168}
Syntax: cast 'ethereal travel' <target>
{300}
This spell lets the target travel through the ethereal planes.
~

0 'ASTRAL PROJECTION'~
{168}
Syntax: cast 'astral project' <target>
{300}
This spell lets the target travel through the astral planes.
~

0 CONFUSION~
{168}
Syntax: cast 'confusion' <target>
{300}
The confusion spell makes the victim occasionally get confused during combat
and attack the handiest body available.  This may be another party member, or
some innocent creature that just happens to be wandering through.  Confusion
is only partially effective as a means to divert attacks, yet is quite handy
against a group of creatures, with few on the casting side, as odds should
point out that there are more bodies to attack on the victim's side.

0 'MAKE POISON' MAKEPOISON~
{168}
Syntax:  makepoison <type> <color> <object>
{300}
The Make Poison skill allows a ninja to put together a batch of various
types of materials, and brew up a very vile poison.  This poison may be placed
upon weapons, ammo, food and drink.  This is quite possibly one of the nastiest
of all abilities in the Realm.

  TYPE is either 'CLEAR' for players or 'MURKY' for mobiles.

  COLOR is one of:
      BLUE   - Slow duration poison of strong strength.
      GREEN  - Combination instant and slow duration.
      PURPLE - Instant damage without duration.

  OBJECT is the object that the poison is being placed upon.

This skill is not only hazardous to make use of, but also the final use of
the poison is hazardous.  If the ninja fails in the task of creating the
poison, it ends up affecting the ninja immediately.  Only the ninja may
see and use the poison weapons that they have created.  Since each ninja is
unique, this applies to other ninjas as well.  Poisons applied to ammo will
affect the victim at approximately one-half normal damage.  Each object may
have only one dosage, yet a creature or player may be affected by numerous
poisons.  Mismatching the TYPE of poison will cause one-half damage.

If a ninja manages to kill a player with poison, he will be credited
with a kill as normal. A smart player will not accept weapons, food, or
generally anything from ninjas, as they may have a bit of vile poison
accidently boobie-trapping the innocent player.

                       1 - Bold
                       3 - Text default (ignores b/c parameters)
