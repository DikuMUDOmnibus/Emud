{308}
Land trade routes to the city of City of calimarra have now
been re-opened by brave dwarven explorers.  The route lies 
through the great eastern desert.  

The city of Calimarra was captured in a daring sea raid
by the famous Ofcol Foreign Legions over 30 years ago.
Before that time the city was ruled by a Theocracy dedicated
to the demon lord Malphas.  A small but persistent rebel
group calling themselves Phoenix is rumored to be working 
to overthrow the foreign rulers.
