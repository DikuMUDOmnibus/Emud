Thor's Peak~
Reaching the peak, it is not as impressive as you had thought.  The
slope levels out to an area about 20 meters across.  To your north
is a great ocean.  To the south a cloud blocks your view of Thor's
canyon.  Your gazing is distracted, however, by an area of slagged
and blasted rock on the peak.

You are finally able to pass over the mountains and begin down the
north side at this point.  The trail, it seems, is well used but
a rockslide has piled a formidable barrier in your way.  No doubt
the satyr scouts will be along someday to clear the path.

A Deep Watery Realm~
All around you is a deep blue water.  Lights which might be fish
seem to move in the far distance.  You notice you are not breathing
in fact, you don't feel any need to breathe.  You recall the beauty
your true love, and your spirit soars.
