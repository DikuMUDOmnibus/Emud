Heart of the Elven Taig~
A single great tree rises from the forest here.  An overwhelming
ancient presence presses on your mind.  You feel your identity 
slipping away, replaced by peace and certainty and permanence.  
You shake your head and blink rapidly trying to clear your senses.  
You feel that soon you will have no desire to leave.

Mercantile Branch~
A large tree branch has been flattened on the top to create a
comfortable area to walk on.  Your throat tightens a bit as you
notice how far it is possible to fall, and that there are no 
rails.  Elven merchants pass you by without much notice.

nervous, perhaps you should attempt to recall.
