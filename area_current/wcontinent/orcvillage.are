Orc village is a small encampment of orcs near elven city.  They were

Outside a wooden gate~
{018}You have approached a wooden palisade in a clearing deep in the elven wood.
The walls are about ten feet high and end in fire hardened points.  They look
to be made of some slow burning hard wood.

fortification, but everyone around seems to be armed and armored.

seems to be where the orcs plan their attacks on the nearby elves.  A map is
strewn across the one table in the room and there are a couple of poorly made
wooden chairs overturned on the floor.  You see flecks of blood on the ground.
The orcs strategy sessions must get pretty violent.

over the place.

may be guessed there is blood all over some of the beds though most if it is

is boiling and letting off a really bad odor.  There are several small tables
around the tent and all of them are covered in things like frog's eyes and
snake's tongues.
