Gaia is the Goddess of the Earth, the sure foundation of all that is.  She
reminds us that the soul develops in dark places and that ultimately the soul
must be rooted in body and in earth.  In order to follow Gaia you must be
between level 10 and 50 and venture deep into the Forest of Gaia which is
located on the Western Continent.

Caramel colored sands lay warm and soft beneath your feet.  Fat, white clouds
are suspended in an azure sky, and the sun shining through the trees creates
delicate patterns on the ground.

Great arbors covered in ivy and sweetly fragranced wisteria canopy the path,
which winds softly like an enormous conch shell.  Leafy fern and pale grasses
are the first line of the border, with magical rowan and oak trees planted
farther back.

Caramel colored sands lay warm and soft beneath your feet.  The land grows more
verdant here, soft grasses starting to overgrow the sands, and trees nestled
closely together.  Brightly colored parrots fly overhead, cawing loudly.

Oak Grove~
You can't help but gasp as you enter this quiet circle of trees.  Oaks, stately
and majestic reach into the skies, their branches curved in an embrace for all
who love nature.  Interspersed are rowan trees, revered since ancient times,
their leaves fluttering quietly.

The Tree of Life~
You know you have entered a serene oasis.  An enormous tree grows here, its
branches broad, with dark, shining green leaves and small, ruby red berries.
Slender ribbons of crimson, ivory and dark green are laced around its smooth
trunk, and tender green grass grows thick and lush around its roots.  It is a
perfect place to rest and reflect.

Cairn of Peace~
The light is diffused here by tall trees growing in a circle.  There are smooth
stones here, piled into conical shapes, appearing to be the resting place of
fallen fellow worshippers.  You can see, far behind the trees, the carefully
tended bodies of those who have recently died.

This is another peaceful oasis, and you notice what might be armor or weaponry
hanging from branches and laying upon rocks.  Animals roam freely, showing
neither fear nor aggression and the trees themselves seem to welcome you.
