{308}
The barrowlands exists to keep interred the Dominator
and his minions, the 'taken'.  The barrowlands are
located north of the elven city.

Besand, the monitor of the barrowlands and captain of
the eternal guard asked that the following message be 
posted:

The barrowlands are not a tourist spot, the only reason
anyone should be there is to trade with the natives
up the river.  Anyone messes with the barrows, and if
if it don't kill you, we will.

There is an important paper here.~
The paper details plans to open an 'ehterial path' into the 
barrowlands.  Apparently there is no way to physically enter
the barrows, the protective magicks are too strong.

One section talks about the 'taken' called Stormbringer.  The
paragraph details the location of the barrow, and something
called the 'elemental rod'.  The words 'ycandus' and 'skeltor'
are scratched in the margins.

One section talks about the 'taken' called the Limper.  The
paper marks the location of his barrow, and something called
the 'mana staff'.  The words 'dreplor' and 'remorec' are
scratched in the margin.         

One section talks about the 'taken' called the Howler.  The
paper details a path to the barrow, and something called
the 'blood stone'  'Strane' and 'putren' are scrawled in
the margin.

One section talks about the 'taken' called Soulcatcher.  There 
is a path to her barrow marked, and something called the
'mind thrasher' is referred to.  The words 'tarway' and 'mantus'
are written.

One section talks about the 'taken' called Shapeshifter.  There
is a marked path to his barrow, and references to some sort of
armor are made.  Something indecipherable is written in the margin.

A whole page details various accounts of a powerful weapon called
'Vengeance', Apparently the weapon was carried by the Dominator's
shieldman.  The word 'ortiblus' is written in the margin.

On this battlefield the forces of the White Rose confronted and
defeated the Dominator, ending a thousand year reign of terror over 
the peoples of the Mortal Realms.  The Dominator, The Lady, and the
'taken', five powerful sorcerers overcome and enslaved by the 
Dominator, are interred in the barrowlands to the north.  The 
power of the White Rose was not sufficient to destroy them and
so they were sealed away, bound by potent magicks, to be guarded 
forever by the spirits of fallen champions of the White Rose.

posted.  A guard beholden to none, charged with preventing
the resurrection of the undead evil beneath the mounds.  The
White Rose understood human nature.  Always there would be
those who would see profit in using or following the Dominator.
Always there would be worshipers of evil who wished their
champion freed.

The barrowland does not have the look of great evil, only of 
neglect.  Four hundred years of vegetation and weather has 
restructured that once marvelous work.  The barrows and mys-
tical landscaping are all but lost amidst the brush covering
them.  Nothing grows well in the barrowlands.  The vegetation 
is twisted and stunted.  Still the shapes of the mounds, and the
menhirs and fetishes which bind the taken, are often concealed.

Atop Shapeshifter's Barrow~
You shudder under the impact of thrumming old spells that 
still keep the undead wizards bound in their barrows.

Atop The Great Barrow~
The ground crackles and hums with energy.  The air is filled with hatred 
as timeless and relentless as the pounding surf along a cold bleak shore.

An Ethereal Pathway~
You step into the ethereal plane.  A path towards the barrowlands has
been opened.  You reel under the awesome power buried there, away from
the might radiating from the menhirs and fetishes.  Seen from this 
viewpoint they take the form of cruel, hideous monsters leashed on
short chains.
