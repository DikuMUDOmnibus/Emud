                               Modifying Clans
{300}
There are several castle options that are only available for clans. Those
options will mostly be displayed in {128}green {300}so you know you are
dealing with one.

Here is a list of clan options and their prices.

Clan   room flags: 100,000,000 Gold
Clan mobile flags: 100,000,000 Gold
Clan   back doors: 500,000,000 Gold

{168}
Syntax: castle connect [<dir>]                         cost: 1,000,000 Gold
{300}
The connect command allows you to connect rooms together.  If you are
connecting rooms within your castle, it's not very expensive.  However,
you are allowed one connection from inside your castle to any other place
in the world; this connection is called a back door.  back doors are quite
expensive and cannot be used as an entrance to your castle, only an exit.

The most basic idea behind creating a connection is that it requires two sides.
This means that to define a connection you will have to do the castle connect
command twice, once for each side of the connection.

castle                shows information about a half made connection.
castle connect clear  will delete a half made connection.
