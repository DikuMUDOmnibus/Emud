{308}
This area is the farthest south one can go in these Realms.  In the
winter it is a frozen wasteland, and in the summer it is still pretty
much a frozen waste.  It is inhabited though and there are opportunities
for much adventure.  The best way to journey to Antarctica is to fly on
Griffon Airlines from the City of Entropy or the City of Sarglam.  The
snow queen rules here with an iron fist but it is rumored that she needs
help with something.

This area was originally written by Mahatma and has since been revised
by Jaxom and Damiana.
